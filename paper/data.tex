\section{Data management}

All the data and formalizations generated by the project are placed in the GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories}}, while the discussion is almost entirely contained in a dedicated channel on the Lean Zulip\footnote{\url{https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/\#narrow/channel/458659-Equational}}.  The implication graph can be downloaded from Equation Explorer\footnote{\url{https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/}}, and can also indicate the individual \emph{Lean} theorems required to establish or refute any given implication, although currently we have only formalized a generating set of implications and refutations in \emph{Lean}, rather than the entirety of the implication graph.
