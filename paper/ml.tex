\section{AI and Machine Learning Contributions}

\note{TODO: expand this sketch}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Claude assistance in coding front ends.
  \item ChatGPT to guess a complete rewriting system.
  \item Minor use of GitHub Copilot to autocomplete code in Lean and other languages.
  \item See this discussion.
  \item Directed Link Prediction (DLP) on the implication graph with multiple GNN autoencoders (see related Zulip topic at \url{https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Graph.20ML.3A.20Directed.20link.20prediction.20on.20the.20implication.20graph}).
\end{itemize}

ML experiments to learn the implication graph.
