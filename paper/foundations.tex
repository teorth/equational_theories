\section{Notation and Mathematical Foundations}\label{notation-sec}

If $\Magma = (M,\op)$ is a magma, we define the left and right multiplication operators $L_a, R_a \colon M \to M$ for $a \in M$ by the formula
\begin{equation}\label{left-right}
    L_x y = R_y x \coloneqq x \op y.
\end{equation}
We also define the squaring operator $S \colon M \to M$ by
\begin{equation}\label{square-def}
    Sx \coloneqq x \op x = L_x x = R_x x.
\end{equation}

A \emph{homomorphism} $f \colon \Magma \to \Magma'$ between two magmas $\Magma = (M,\op)$, $\Magma' = (M',\op')$ is a function $f \colon M \to M'$ such that $f(x \op y) = f(x) \op' f(y)$ for all $x,y \in M$.  An \emph{isomorphism} is a homomorphism that is invertible (which implies that the inverse is also a homomorphism).  An \emph{endomorphism} is a homomorphism from a magma to itself.

If $X$ is an alphabet, we let $\Magma_X$ denote the free magma generated by $X$, thus an element of $\Magma_X$ is either a letter in $X$, or of the form $w_1 \op w_2$ with $w_1,w_2 \in \Magma_X$.  Every function $f \colon X \to M$ into a magma $\Magma = (M,\op)$ extends to a unique homomorphism $\varphi_f \colon \Magma_X \to \Magma$.  Formally, an equational law with some indeterminates in $X$ can be written as $w_1 \formaleq w_2$ for some $w_1, w_2 \in X$; a magma $\Magma = (M,\op)$ then obeys this law if and only if $\varphi_f(w_1) = \varphi_f(w_2)$ for all $f \colon X \to M$.  We also define the order of a word $w \in \Magma_X$ to be the number of occurrences of $\op$ in the word, thus letters in $X$ are of order $0$, and the order of $w_1 \op w_2$ is the sum of the orders of $w_1, w_2$.

A \emph{theory} is a collection $\Gamma$ of equational laws; we say that a magma $\Magma$ \emph{satisfies} a theory, and write $\Magma \models \Gamma$, if every law in $\Gamma$ is obeyed by $\Magma$.  If $E$ is an equational law, we write $\Gamma \vdash E$ if every magma that satisfies $\Gamma$ also satisfies $E$. A \emph{free magma} $\Magma_{X,\Gamma}$ for such a theory $\Gamma$ and an alphabet $X$ is a magma satisfying $\Gamma$ together with a map $\iota_{X,\Gamma} \colon X \to \Magma_{X,\Gamma}$ which is universal in the sense that every function $f \colon X \to \Magma$ to a magma $\Magma$ satisfying $\Gamma$ uniquely determines a homomorphism $\varphi_{f,\Gamma} \colon \Magma_{X,\Gamma} \to \Magma$ such that $\phi_{f,\Gamma} \circ \iota_{X,\Gamma} = f$.  This magma is unique up to isomorphism; a canonical way to construct it is as the quotient $\Magma_X/\sim_\Gamma$ of the free magma $\Magma_X$ by the equivalence relation $\sim_\Gamma$ given by declaring $w \sim_\Gamma w'$ if $\Gamma \vdash w \formaleq w'$ \cite[Theorem 3.5.6]{term-rewriting}.  If $\Gamma = \{E\}$ consists of a single law $E$, we write $\Magma_{X,E}$, $\sim_E$, $\varphi_{f,E}$ for $\Magma_{X,\{E\}}$, $\sim_{\{E\}}$, $\varphi_{f,\{E\}}$ respectively.

In general, the free magma $\Magma_{X,\Gamma}$ is difficult to describe in a tractable form, but for some theories, one has a simple description:

\begin{example}[Commutative and associative free magma]\label{semi-group} The free magma $\Magma_{X,\{\Eq{43}, \Eq{4512}\}}$ for the commutative law \eqref{eq43} and the associative law \eqref{eq4512} is the free abelian semigroup generated by $X$ (with $\iota_{X,\{\Eq{43},\Eq{4512}\}}$ the obvious embedding map).
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Left-absorptive free magma]\label{left-absorb}
The free magma $\Magma_{X,\{\Eq{4}\}}$ for the left-absorptive law \eqref{eq4} is the magma with carrier $X$ and operation $x \op y = x$ (with $\iota_{X,\Eq{4}}$ the identity).
\end{example}


Every magma $\Magma$ has an opposite $\Magma^{\mathrm{op}}$, which has the same carrier but the opposite operation $x \op^{\mathrm{op}} y \coloneqq y \op x$.  A magma $\Magma$ obeys an equational law $E$ if and only if its opposite $\Magma^{\mathrm{op}}$ obeys the dual law $E^*$, defined by reversing the all operations.  For instance, the dual of
$\x \op \y \formaleq \x \op (\y \op \z)$ \eqref{eq327} is $\y \op \x \formaleq (\z \op \y) \op \x$, which in our numbering system we rewrite in normal form as $\x \op \y \formaleq (\z \op \x) \op \y$ \eqref{eq395}.

We then see that the implication graph has a duality symmetry: given two equational laws $E_1,E_2$, we have $E_1 \vdash E_2$ if and only if $E_1^* \vdash E_2^*$.

\section{Formal Foundations}

\note{TODO: expand this sketch.}

All proofs in the ETP were ultimately formalized in the proof assistant language \emph{Lean}, though in many cases the proofs were first written either in informal human document, which was then incorporated into the human-readable \emph{blueprint}\footnote{https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint} that accompanied the formalization.  Many of the computer assisted proofs were also first generated as computer output from a source other than Lean, such as an ATP, and later converted to a Lean proof by a separate program custom written for this task.

The project relied on Lean's extensive \emph{Mathlib} library, for instance to provide support for algebraic concepts such as the free group that arose in some of the more difficult constructions.  The concept of a magma could be modeled by the Mathlib class \texttt{Mul}, however we chose early in the project to define a custom magma class \texttt{Magma} instead, as for some magma constructions the magma operation (which we denoted $\op$) was distinct from an existing multiplication structure $*$ on the same carrier.  Most components of the Lean codebase were placed in namespaces to avoid collisions with each other, and with Mathlib.

Equational laws in the project were implemented both syntactically - as a structure \texttt{LawX} containing two words in a free group - as well as syntactically, as a predicate \texttt{EquationX} that could be applied to a magma, with some \emph{ad hoc} metaprogramming to pass from one to the other.  Here \texttt{X} is the number assigned to the law.  The syntactic formulation was more convenient for proving or refuting specific implications, while the semantic formulation was preferred for implementing metatheorems, such as the use of duality between laws.

To facilitate the automatic generation of an implication graph from the Lean codebase, a custom \texttt{@{[}equational\_result{]}} tag was formed to attach to  propositions in Lean to indicate that they were proving or refuting one or more implications; see \Cref{fig:impl}.  A \texttt{conjecture} keyword was also created for implications or refutations which we wished to identify as having an informal proof that had yet to be formalized in Lean.

A single construction of a magma could obey multiple laws $E_1,E_2,\dots$ and not obey others $E'_1, E'_2, \dots$, leading to a large number of refutations of the form $E_i \nvdash E'_j$.  A custom \texttt{Facts} command was designed to organize such information efficiently; see \Cref{fig:facts}.

As an additional precaution against ``exploit''-based proofs (such as those that might be contributed by an AI tool) \emph{lean4checker} was used to ensure that no axioms were used in \emph{Lean} outside of a small trusted set.  In particular, \emph{Lean} tactics such as \emph{native\_decide} that relied on external tools were not permitted into the codebase. \textbf{This is my vague understanding of the situation - someone with experience should validate this.}

Some lemmas generated in the project were suitable for upstreaming back to \emph{Mathlib}, as well as several technical improvements to the \emph{LeanBlueprint} software.
