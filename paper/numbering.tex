\section{Numbering system}\label{numbering-app}

In this section we record the numbering conventions we use for equational laws.

For this formal definition we use the natural numbers $0,1,2,\dots$ to represent and order indeterminate variables; however, in the main text, we use the symbols $x,y,z,w,u,v,r,s,t$ instead (and do not consider any laws with more than eight variables).

We requiring extend the ordering on indeterminate variables to a well-ordering on words $w$ in the free magma generated by these variables by declaring $w > w'$ if one of the following holds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $w$ has a larger order than $w'$.
    \item $w = w_1 \op w_2$ and $w' = w'_1 \op w'_2$ have the same order $n \geq 1$ with $w_1 > w'_1$.
    \item $w = w_1 \op w_2$ and $w' = w'_1 \op w'_2$ have the same order $n \geq 1$ with $w_1 = w'_1$ and $w_2 > w'_2$.
\end{itemize}
Thus for instance
$$ 0 < 1 < 0 \op 0 < 0 \op 1 < 1 \op 0 $$
and
$$ 1 \op 1 < 0 \op (0 \op 0) < (0 \op 0) \op 0.$$

We similarly place a well-ordering on equational laws $w_1 \formaleq w_2$ by declaring $w_1 \formaleq w_2 > w'_1 \formaleq w'_2$ if one of the following holds:
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item  $w_1 \formaleq w_2$ has a longer order than $w'_1 \formaleq w'_2$.
\item If $w_1 \formaleq w_2$ has the same order as $w'_1 \formaleq w'_2$, and $w_1 > w'_1$.
\item If $w_1 \formaleq w_2$ has the same order as $w'_1 \formaleq w'_2$, $w_1 = w'_1$, and $w_2 > w'_2$.
\end{itemize}

Two equational laws are equivalent if one can be obtained from another by some combination of relabeling the variables and applying the symmetric law $w_1 \formaleq w_2 \iff w_2 \formaleq w_1$.  For instance, $(0 \op 1) \op 2 \formaleq 1$ is equivalent to $0 \formaleq (1 \op 0) \op 2$.  We then eliminate all equational laws that are not minimal in their equivalence class; for instance, we would eliminate $(0 \op 1) \op 2 \formaleq 1$ in favor of $0 \formaleq (1 \op 0) \op 2$.  Finally, we eliminate any law of the form $w \formaleq w$ other than $0 \formaleq 0$.  We then number the remaining equations $E1, E2, \dots$.  For instance, $E1$ is the trivial law $0 \formaleq 0$, $E2$ is the constant law $0 \formaleq 1$, $E3$ is the idempotent law $0 \formaleq 0 \op 0$, and so forth.  Lists and code for generating these equations, or the equation number attached to a given equation, can be found at the ETP repository.

The number of equations in this list of order $n=0,1,2,\dots$ is given by
$$ 2, 5, 39, 364, 4284, 57882, 888365, \dots$$
(\url{https://oeis.org/A376640}).  The number can be computed to be
$$ C_{n+1} B_{n+2}/2$$
if $n$ is odd, $2$ if $n=0$, and
$$ (C_{n+1} B_{n+2}+ C_{n/2}(2D_{n+2}-B_{n+2}))/2 - C_{n/2} B_{n/2+1}$$
if $n > 2$ is even, where $C_n, B_n$ are the Catalan and Bell numbers, and $D_n$ is the number of partitions of $[n]$ up to reflection, which for $n=0,1,2,\dots$ is
$$ 1, 1, 2, 4, 11, 32, 117, \dots$$
(\url{https://oeis.org/A103293}).  A proof of this claim can be found in the ETP blueprint.  In particular, there are $4694$ equations of order at most $4$.
