# Contributions

We will proceed systematically by discussing, interpreting, and extending each of
the [CReDiT categories](https://credit.niso.org/):

- **Conceptualization**: Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.
- **Data Curation**: Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later reuse.  [This includes contributions to, or maintenance of, the blueprint for the project.]
- **Formal Analysis**: Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.  [This encompasses any efforts to analyze the implication graph, for instance using machine learning tools or statistical analysis.]
- **Funding Acquisition**: Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.
- **Investigation**: Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection. [This includes producing any mathematical investigation of a given implication between equational laws.]
- **Methodology**: Development or design of methodology; creation of models.  [This includes developing new techniques to settle implications.]
- **Project Administration**: Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.
- **Resources**: Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.
- **Software**: Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.
- **Supervision**: Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.
- **Validation**: Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.  [This includes both Lean formalization efforts, as well as contributions to other verification steps such as continuous integration (CI).]
- **Visualization**: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.  [This includes development of web interfaces and graphical visualization tools.]
- **Writing - Original Draft Preparation**: Creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).
- **Writing – Review and Editing**: Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision – including pre- or post-publication stages.

Once these extended categories are well-defined and agreed upon, individual contributors can easily
identify their contributions across the relevant categories and propose to attribute them
accordingly via a PR filling a simple table with a checkmark (✅).

We could have a longer, less schematic description too written below the table to make sure that
some major not-easily-classifiable contribution is not left out.
