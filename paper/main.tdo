\contentsline {todo}{Discuss this further, perhaps give an example, or refer to the ATP section.

\contentsline {todo}{Report on how large the twisting semigroups are in practice, and how many implications can be refuted by this method.}{20}{section*.9}%
\contentsline {todo}{Describe performance of this automated method. Discuss the issue that some implications required a large SAT solver calculation that was difficult to formalize efficiently in Lean, prompting human-generated simplified proofs using smaller rulesets.}{23}{section*.10}%
