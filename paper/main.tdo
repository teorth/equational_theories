\contentsline {todo}{Report on how large the twisting semigroups are in practice, and how many implications can be refuted by this method.}{27}{section*.3}%
\contentsline {todo}{Describe performance of this automated method. Discuss the issue that some implications required a large SAT solver calculation that was difficult to formalize efficiently in Lean, prompting human-generated simplified proofs using smaller rulesets.}{29}{section*.4}%
