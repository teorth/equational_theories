\contentsline {todo}{Discuss how the above breaks down when a large and diverse collection of collaborators work over the internet.

\contentsline {todo}{Discuss this further, perhaps give an example, or refer to the ATP section. See also the discussion threads ``Counterexamples by enumerating words in quotient magmas'' and ``Using SAT solvers for model generation'' threads (sorry, LaTeX is choking on the URLs for some reason).}{14}{section*.5}%

\contentsline {todo}{Report on how large the twisting semigroups are in practice, and how many implications can be refuted by this method.}{19}{section*.8}%
\contentsline {todo}{Describe performance of this automated method. Discuss the issue that some implications required a large SAT solver calculation that was difficult to formalize efficiently in Lean, prompting human-generated simplified proofs using smaller rulesets.}{22}{section*.9}%

\contentsline {todo}{throw a couple of "benchmarking" tables for the same ATP with different parameters and for different ATPs, talk about some relative gains in time (changing parameters we saw a 500 times speedup on this particular problem), etc. This is knowledge I think we have gained to some extent, and certainly I would have been glad to receive this kind of hints before we started!''.
