\contentsline {todo}{Collect a couple of example github issues/tickets of soundness bugs across ITPs}{16}{section*.5}%
\contentsline {todo}{This would be a good point to describe the role of maintainers and reviewing. It would also serve to explain how the external checkers integrate with the CI. Maybe we can blend it all into what has been written so far}{17}{section*.6}%
\contentsline {todo}{elaborate on what level of overlap was permissible and what we consider excessive}{19}{section*.7}%
\contentsline {todo}{Report on how large the twisting semigroups are in practice, and how many implications can be refuted by this method.}{25}{section*.8}%
\contentsline {todo}{Describe performance of this automated method. Discuss the issue that some implications required a large SAT solver calculation that was difficult to formalize efficiently in Lean, prompting human-generated simplified proofs using smaller rulesets.}{28}{section*.9}%

\contentsline {todo}{throw a couple of "benchmarking" tables for the same ATP with different parameters and for different ATPs, talk about some relative gains in time (changing parameters we saw a 500 times speedup on this particular problem), etc. This is knowledge I think we have gained to some extent, and certainly I would have been glad to receive this kind of hints before we started!''. Then leave it as an interesting open problem to properly develop and measure benchmarks for ATPs based on this project.}{42}{section*.16}%
