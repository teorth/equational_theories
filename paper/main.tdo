\contentsline {todo}{Report on how large the twisting semigroups are in practice, and how many implications can be refuted by this method.}{21}{section*.6}%
\contentsline {todo}{Describe performance of this automated method. Discuss the issue that some implications required a large SAT solver calculation that was difficult to formalize efficiently in Lean, prompting human-generated simplified proofs using smaller rulesets.}{23}{section*.7}%

\contentsline {todo}{throw a couple of "benchmarking" tables for the same ATP with different parameters and for different ATPs, talk about some relative gains in time (changing parameters we saw a 500 times speedup on this particular problem), etc. This is knowledge I think we have gained to some extent, and certainly I would have been glad to receive this kind of hints before we started!''.
