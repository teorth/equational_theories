\section{Counterexample constructions}

\note{TODO: Expand this sketch}

Describe various sources of example magmas used in counterexamples, including the ones listed here. Note that linear magmas let one assign an "affine scheme" to each law that can be used to rule out many, but not all, implications.

Discuss semi-automated creation of finite counterexamples (as discussed here)

Also note some "negative results" - classes of finite magmas that did not yield many additional refutations, e.g. commutative 5x5 magmas.

Translation-invariant magmas (see e.g., this thread for a nice example). Note: any magma with a transitive symmetry will lift to a translation-invariant model, so this helps explain why these are common examples. Also symmetric models could be slightly more likely to obey various laws than general models due to degree of freedom considerations.

Using SAT solvers to find medium sized finite magmas obeying a given law? See this discussion.

Tree based constructions, see here.

Discuss computational and memory efficiencies needed to brute force over extremely large sets of magmas. SAT solving may be a better approach past a certain size!
