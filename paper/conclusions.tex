\section{Conclusions and Future Directions}

\note{TODO: Expand this sketch}

Insights learned, future speculation. Utilize the discussion on future directions. Some ideas from that list:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A database of triple implications (EquationX and EquationY imply EquationZ) - see also this discussion.
  \item Are there any equational laws that have no non-trivial finite models, but have surjunctive models?
  \item Can we produce interesting examples of irreducible implications EquationX -> EquationY (no intermediate EquationZ can interpose)
  \item Degree of satisfiability results, e.g., if a central groupoid obeys the natural central groupoid axiom 99\% of the time, is it a natural central groupoid?
  \item Kisielewicz's question: does 5093 have any infinite models?
  \item "Insight mining" the large corpus of automated proofs that have been generated.
  \item How machine-learnable is the implication graph? (See AI/ML section)
\end{itemize}
