Data analysis of the implication graph

\begin{itemize}
    \item Mention the long chain 2 => 5 => 2499 => 2415 => 238 => 2716 => 28 => 2973 => 270 => 3 => 3715 => 375 => 359 => 4065 => 1 (discussed here).
\item What are the "most difficult" implications?
\item Is there a way to generate a standard test set of implication problems of various difficulty levels? Can one then use this to benchmark various automated and semi-automated methods? Challenge: how does one automatically assign a difficulty level to a given (anti-)implication?
\end{itemize}

See this for a preliminary data analysis of the impact of equation size and the number of variables.

Analyze the implication graph and discuss test sets of implication problems for benchmarking theorem provers. Challenge: How can one automatically assign a difficulty level to an implication?
