This law implies that left and right multiplications are surjective.  The operations defined by `x : y = (y ◇ y) ◇ (y ◇ x)` and `x / y = x : ((x ◇ x) : y)` satisfy `y ◇ (y : x) = x` and `(x / y) ◇ y = x`, hence they can serve as (not necessarily unique) left and right divisions.  In addition, `(y / x) : y = x`.

Finite magmas satisfying this law are quasigroups.
