This law states that left and right cubes are equal, and that left multiplications by any square are equal.  The set of squares is a submagma.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the fact that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same central element.
