This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the dual of [law 3756](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3756), and equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same right unit element `e` (namely `x◇e = x`) such that `x◇y = e◇(y◇x)`.  Note that `e◇(e◇x) = x`.
