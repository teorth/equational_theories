This law implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).

The submagma `P = {x◇y| x,y∈M}` obeys [law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492), the commutative version of the [Putnam law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).  Apart from commutativity, the product of two elements in the set `M ∖ P` only has to lie in `P`.
