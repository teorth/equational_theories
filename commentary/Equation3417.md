This law implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).

The submagma `P = {x◇y| x,y∈M}` is a totally symmetric quasigroup, namely it obeys [law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492).  The operation `◇ : M × M → P` can be split into the totally symmetric quasigroup operation on `P`, an operation `(M ∖ P) × P → P` for which left-multiplication is involutive (and its symmetric operation `P × (M ∖ P) → P`), and an operation `(M ∖ P) × (M ∖ P) → P` that is merely symmetric.

The image of the cubing map `x ↦ x◇(x◇x) = (x◇x)◇x` is `P`.

In a quasigroup, `P` coincides with `M` so this law is simply equivalent to law 492.
