This law implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).

The submagma `P = {x◇y| x,y∈M}` is a totally symmetric quasigroup, namely it obeys [law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492).  The operation `◇ : M × M → P` can be split into the totally symmetric quasigroup operation on `P`, an unconstrained operation `P × (M ∖ P) → P`, an operation `(M ∖ P) × P → P` for which left-multiplication is involutive, and an operation `(M ∖ P) × (M ∖ P) → P` that is merely symmetric.
