This law implies that all left multiplications are bijective.  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies the same law, namely `x = y : (y : (x : (x : y)))`.  The operation defined by `x ◆ y = x ◇ (x ◇ y)` satisfies the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) and in particular the map `x ↦ x◇(x◇y)` is bijective for all `y`.

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [unknown](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
