This law implies that all left multiplications are bijective.  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies the same law, namely `x = y : (y : (x : (x : y)))`.  The operation defined by `x ◆ y = x ◇ (x ◇ y)` satisfies the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) and in particular the map `x ↦ x◇(x◇y)` is bijective for all `y`.
