## A conjectural Austin law

An Austin law is a law which has infinite models, but no non-trivial finite models. [Kisielewicz showed](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#Kisielewicz2) that [this law has no non-trivial finite models](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-model-chapter.html#5093-nontrivial), but it remains open whether there is an infinite model.

Note: due to a [numbering error](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.205105.20-.3E.20Equation.202/near/478252043), this equation was initially labeled 5105.
