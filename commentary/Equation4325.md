This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 4270](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4270) (right multiplications by squares all coincide) and [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273) (right crossed-inverse property, namely `y ◇ (x ◇ y)` is independent of `y`).

The set of squares, and the set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`, are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is such that `S(S(x))` is constant, hence `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
