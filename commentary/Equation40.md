## The unipotence law

This law states that all squares are equal to the same element `e`, which is thus itself the only idempotent element (`e◇e=e`) in the magma.  Equivalently the element is called middle neutral.

In particular the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.
