This law is a twist of [law 118](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?118) by the squaring map `S: x↦x◇x`.  It implies that left multiplications are surjective and that `S` is injective.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial semigroup (associative magma).

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [unknown](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
