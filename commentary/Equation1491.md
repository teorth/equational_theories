## The "Obelix" equation

Closely related to the ["Asterix" equation, 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65).  In particular, [the "Asterix" and "Obelix" equations are equivalent for finite magmas, but neither implies the other for infinite ones](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-magma-constructions-chapter.html#asterix-section)!

A greedy translation-invariant construction of Obelix magmas is [given here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Obelix.3A.20joining.20two.20approaches).

This law implies that left multiplications are injective.
