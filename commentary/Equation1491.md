## The "Obelix" equation

Closely related to the ["Asterix" equation, 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65).  In particular, the "Asterix" and "Obelix" equations are equivalent for finite magmas or for quasigroups, but neither implies the other for [infinite ones](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-magma-constructions-chapter.html#asterix-section).

A greedy translation-invariant construction of Obelix magmas is [given here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Obelix.3A.20joining.20two.20approaches).

This law implies that left multiplications are injective and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is a bijection of order 3, namely `S(S(S(x))) = x`.
