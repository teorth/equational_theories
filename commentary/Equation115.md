This law implies that left and right multiplications are surjective and the squaring map is injective.  The operations defined by `x : y = (y ◇ y) ◇ x` and `x / y = (y ◇ y) ◇ (x ◇ x)` obey `y ◇ (y : x) = x` and `(x / y) ◇ y = x`, hence they can serve as (not necessarily unique) left and right divisions.  In addition, `(y / x) : y = x`.

For finite magmas, or for quasigroups, the dual [law 219](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?219) is equivalent to [law 880](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?880), which is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).
