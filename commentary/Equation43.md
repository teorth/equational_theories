## The commutative law

The [commutative law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property) is one of the most famous laws in all of algebra.

A law is implied by the commutative law if and only if the right-hand side can be obtained from the left-hand side by a finite number of applications of the commutative law to interchange two inputs to the magma operation.

As noted by [Stein in 1957](https://doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9947-1957-0094404-6), a quasigroup satisfies this law if and only if the right division operation defined by `(x/y)â—‡y=x` satisfies the [involutive left-multiplication law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), so law 16 and 43 are parastrophically equivalent.

The number of magmas of size n (modulo isomorphism) satisfying this law is the [OEIS sequence A001425](https://oeis.org/A001425).
