## The commutative law

The [commutative law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property) is one of the most famous laws in all of algebra.

A law is implied by the commutative law if and only if the right-hand side can be obtained from the left-hand side by a finite number of applications of the commutative law to interchange two inputs to the magma operation.
