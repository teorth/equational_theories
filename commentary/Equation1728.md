The anti-implication of this equation to [Equation 99](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?99) can be established by an infinite tree construction.  This was discussed in terms of the dual laws 1841 and 203 in [this discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1841.20.3F.3D.3E.20203).

In a quasigroup this law is equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x` together with [law 124](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?124) `x = y◇((y◇x)◇x)`.  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
