## A (finite) left crossed inverse quasigroup law

For finite magmas this law is equivalent to stating that the magma is a quasigroup with the left crossed inverse property [law 4588](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4588) `(y◇x)◇y = f(x)` and that `f(x)=(x◇x)◇x` is an involution, namely `f(f(x))=x`.
