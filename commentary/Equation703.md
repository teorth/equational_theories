This law implies that left multiplications are bijective and square to the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` (namely `y◇(y◇x) = x◇(x◇x)`) whose inverse is the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x`.  Both of these maps are bijections of order 3 in the sense that `B(B(B(x))) = x` and `C(C(C(x))) = x`.

The proofs of the implications from this law to several other laws ([1426](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1426), [1434](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1434), [4275](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4275), [4307](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4307)) involve an intermediate step of order 26, which is [by far the highest](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Which.20implications.20are.20harder.20for.20ATPs/with/547257323) of all implications between laws of order up to 4.  This intermediate step is [law 66267086158898342401601608904835058](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?66267086158898342401601608904835058), which simply states that `C(C(C(x))) = x`.
