This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a quasigroup (more generally when left multiplications are injective) this law is equivalent to [law 335](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?335) `x◇y = y◇(y◇x)` and it implies the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x`.
