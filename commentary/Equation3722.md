## A 1978 Putnam law

Connected to [Equation 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?381) and [Equation 3744](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3744).  Problem A4 of the 1978 Putnam asked to show (in our language) that [Equation 3744 implies Equations 3722 and 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#3744_implies_3722_381). 

States that all elements of the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` square to themselves.  In particular the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.  The set of products `P`, the set of squares, and the set of idempotents coincide.

In a quasigroup this law is equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x`.  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
