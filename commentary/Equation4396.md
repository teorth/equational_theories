## The left alternative law

Magmas satisfying both this law and its dual are called alternative.  This weak two-variable restriction of associativity is neither weaker nor stronger than the flexible identity.  Rings whose multiplication satisfies this law are referenced under the codes 17D05 and 17D15 in the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC 2020).
