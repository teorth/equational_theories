This law implies that the magma operation is idempotent.

This law is part of a [longest chain of implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Longest.20implication.20chain/near/521750611) 2 → … → 9 → 418 → 48 → … → 1 between inequivalent laws of order up to 4.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or (quasi)group.
