This law implies that left multiplications are bijective.

In a quasigroup, this law implies that there is a bijective involution `Q: x ↦ ((x◇x)◇x)◇(x◇x)` such that `x◇(Q(x)◇y) = y` and `Q(x)◇(x◇y) = y` and `(x◇y)◇Q(x) = Q(y)` and `Q(x◇y) = y◇x` (in particular, `Q` acts trivially on squares).  These properties are analogous to crossed inverse properties, see [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273).
