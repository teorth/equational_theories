This law is equivalent to stating that the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is an involution (`C(C(x)) = x`) and that left multiplication by any square coincides with it, namely [law 4590](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4590) `(y◇y)◇x = C(x)` holds.

The [half-group law 3737](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3737) `x◇y = (x◇z) ◇ (y◇z)`, together with either one of law 1718 or the weaker [law 1731](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1731) `x = (y◇y) ◇ ((y◇y)◇x)`, characterizes the group division operation `x◇y = x y⁻¹`.
