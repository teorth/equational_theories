This law implies that squaring is injective and that the left fourth power `f: x ↦ x◇(x◇(x◇x))` is surjective, with `f(S(x)) = x`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all left cubes `x◇(x◇x)` are equal to the same element `e` and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and right-multiplication map `x ↦ x◇e` are inverse bijections.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
