This law implies that squaring is injective and that the left fourth power `f: x ↦ x◇(x◇(x◇x))` is surjective, with `f(S(x)) = x`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all left cubes `x◇(x◇x)` are equal to the same element `e` such that `x = (x◇x)◇e`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
