This law implies that the magma operation is idempotent.

In a quasigroup this law is equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x` together with [law 264](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?264) `x = ((x◇y)◇y)◇y` stating that right multiplications cube to the identity.  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
