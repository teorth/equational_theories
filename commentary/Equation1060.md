This law states that products of the form `(x◇(_◇x))◇x` are right units.  It implies that squares are right units ([law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11), `x = x◇(y◇y)`), and their right cosets too, namely [law 109](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?109), `x = x◇((y◇y)◇z)`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
