This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) group.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).

In a left quasigroup, this law holds if and only if the left division operation defined by `x â—‡ (x : y) = y` obeys [law 66](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?66) `x = y:(x:(y:y))`, so these two laws are parastrophically equivalent.
