This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.  Similarly to [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) and [law 50](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?50), once the squaring map is chosen, the law constrains each left multiplication independently.
