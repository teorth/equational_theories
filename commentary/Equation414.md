This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.  Similarly to [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) and [law 50](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?50), once the squaring map is chosen, the law constrains each left multiplication independently.

In a left quasigroup this law implies that all squares are equal to some element `e` ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) and `x = x ◇ (x ◇ (x ◇ e))`.  It is equivalent to stating that the left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys the right-unit left-fourth-powers [law 440](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?440) `x = x : (y:(y:(y:y)))`, namely laws 414 and 440 are parastrophically equivalent.
