This law is a twist of [law 105](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?105) by the squaring map.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the left crossed-inverse property `(y◇x)◇y = C(x)` (dual to [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273)) together with the one-variable [law 1629](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1629) `x = (x◇x) ◇ ((x◇x)◇x)`.
