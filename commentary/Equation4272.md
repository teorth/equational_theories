This law states that right multiplication by a square is a constant map.  The set of squares is thus a left ideal (hence a submagma) obeying the [right unar law 39](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?39) `y◇s = s◇s` for any square `s`.  The set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`, or equivalently of squared squares `(x◇x)◇(x◇x)` is a further submagma.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
