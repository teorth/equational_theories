This law implies that left multiplications are bijective.  It also implies that the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is an involution and that

- for any fixed point `x = B(x)`, left multiplication by `x` is an involution;

- for any two-cycle `x ≠ B(x)`, left multiplication by `x` is a bijection (whose square maps `x` to `B(x)`), and left multiplication by `B(x)` is its inverse bijection.
