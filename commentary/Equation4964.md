## The Steiner quasigroup ("squag") law

This law is equivalent to the [totally-symmetric quasigroup law](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492) together with the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3).  Equivalent in turn to the [Putnam law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14), the idempotence law 3, and the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together.

Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with Steiner triple systems, with the operation defined by `x ◇ x = x` and `x ◇ y = z` (and all permutations thereof) whenever `x,y,z` form a triple.

There are between 152 and 199 equivalent laws of order 5 defining Steiner triple systems.  The lowest-numbered ones are 4964, 5011, 5071, 5133, 5359, 5830.
