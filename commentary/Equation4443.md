This law is [Stein's second law](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00796), as named by Sade [1].

In a right quasigroup, this law is obeyed if and only if the right division operation defined by `(x/y)◇y = x` obeys the [Asterix law 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65), so laws 65 and 4443 are parastrophically equivalent.  The same holds among left quasigroups since law 4443 is self-dual.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
