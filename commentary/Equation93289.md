## A candidate law for groups of exponent 3

This law holds in all groups of exponent 3, and for finite magma it implies that the magma is a group of exponent 3 (not necessarily abelian).  It is unknown whether the implication holds for infinite magmas.  See the commentary of law [163669](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?163669) for references.
