## The reduction law

LIR groupoids are magmas satisfying this law together with the [left normal law](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4673) and [idempotence](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3).  See [Romanowslca, 1988](https://doi.org/10.1515/dema-1988-0409).

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S`, with the product `[s, …, t] ◇ [u, …, v] = [s, …, t, u]`.
