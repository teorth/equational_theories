## The right reduction law

Partitioning the magma by the equivalence relation `x~y` if right multiplications coincide, namely `∀z,z◇x=z◇y`, the law states that right multiplications leave each equivalence class invariant.  Magma operations satisfying this law are thus in one-to-one correspondence with equivalence relations on the set, together with an action of the quotient set on each of the equivalence classes (separately).

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ`, with the product `[s, …, t] ◇ [u, …, v] = [s, …, t, u]`.

LIR groupoids are magmas satisfying this law together with the [left normal law](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4673) and [idempotence](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3).  The acronym LIR stands for left-normal, idempotent, and reduction.  See [Romanowslca, 1988](https://doi.org/10.1515/dema-1988-0409).
