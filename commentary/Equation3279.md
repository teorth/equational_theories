This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In quasigroups (more generally when left multiplications are injective), this law is equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x` together with [law 125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125) `x = y◇((y◇x)◇y)`.
