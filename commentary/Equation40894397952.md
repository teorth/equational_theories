## The ortholattice Sheffer stroke law

It was shown by [McCune, Padmanabhan, Rose, Veroff](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00012-004-1902-0) that a magma operation satisfies this law if and only if it is the Sheffer stroke of an [ortholattice](https://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/structures/doku.php?id=ortholattices).

This order 10 law with four variables has the lowest possible order, but there might exist equivalent three-variable laws.
