## A law for sets equipped with an involution

This law is equivalent to stating that the magma operation is right-projection composed with squaring (namely `x◇y=y◇y`, a form of [law 39](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?39)) and that squaring is an involution (namely `x = (x◇x)◇(x◇x)`, [law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151)).  The second condition can be replaced by the shorter [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x=x◇(x◇x)`.

The equivalence class of this law is the third-largest one (112 laws in our list of 4694 laws), more than the right-projection [law 5](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?5).

Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with sets equipped with an involution.

Magmas satisfying this law are always submagmas of linear magmas satifying this law.  This law cannot hold in any (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of two copies of `S` mapped to each other by the involution.
