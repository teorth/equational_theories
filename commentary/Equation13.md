## A law for sets equipped with an involution

This law is equivalent to stating that the magma operation is right-projection composed with squaring (namely `x◇y=y◇y`, a form of [law 39](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?39)) and that squaring is an involution (namely `x = (x◇x)◇(x◇x)`, [law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151)).  The second condition can be replaced by the shorter [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x=x◇(x◇x)`.

Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with sets equipped with an involution.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of two copies of `S` mapped to each other by the involution.
