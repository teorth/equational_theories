This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.  It implies that the set of squares is a right ideal (hence a submagma) which coincides with the set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`.  The set of right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` is also an ideal, which might be able to differ from the set of squares.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
