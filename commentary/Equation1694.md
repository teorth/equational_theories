This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a quasigroup, this law implies that all left cubes `B(x) = x◇(x◇x)` are equal to the same element `e` that squares to itself, that [law 23](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?23) `(x◇x)◇x = x` holds, and that that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is a bijection with inverse map `x ↦ e◇x`.
