This law is a twist of two laws by the map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)`, [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) twisted as `x◇(y◇x) = B(x)`, and [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) twisted as `x◇(y◇y) = B(x)`.

This law implies that squares form a submagma.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
