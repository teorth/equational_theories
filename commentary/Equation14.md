## The semi-symmetric quasigroup law, a 2001 Putnam law

Problem A1 of the 2001 Putnam asked to show that [Equation 14 implies Equation 29](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#14_implies_29). In fact, this law is equivalent to [Equation 29](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?29).

This law characterizes semi-symmetric quasigroups, namely left and right multiplication are bijective (the magma is a quasigroup) and the corresponding left and right divisions are given by right and left multiplication, respectively.  More symmetrically, for three elements of the magma, the identities `x◇y=z`, `y◇z=x`, `z◇x=y` are equivalent.

Among equations of order 2 this is the one whose [simple spectrum](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Simple.20and.20.28sub.29directly.20irreducible.20spectrum) is the most difficult to determine.

- Law 14 and commutativity ⇔ totally-symmetric quasigroup [law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492).
- Law 14 and existence of a two-sided unit ⇔ semi-symmetric loop [law 887](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?887).
- Law 14 and idempotence ⇔ Mendelsohn quasigroup [law 4961](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4961).
- Law 14 and associativity ⇔ [law 895](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?895) characterizing abelian groups of exponent 2.

The number of magmas of size n (modulo isomorphisms) satisfying this law is the [OEIS sequence A076017](https://oeis.org/A076017), whose asymptotics appear unknown.
