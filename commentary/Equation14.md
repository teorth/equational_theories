## The semi-symmetric quasigroup law, a 2001 Putnam law

Problem A1 of the 2001 Putnam asked to show that [Equation 14 implies Equation 29](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#14_implies_29). In fact, this law is equivalent to [Equation 29](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?29).

This law characterizes semi-symmetric quasigroups, namely any magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) and the corresponding left and right divisions are given by right and left multiplication, respectively.  More symmetrically, for three elements of the magma, the identities `x◇y=z`, `y◇z=x`, `z◇x=y` are equivalent.

Among equations of order 2 this is the one whose [simple spectrum](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Simple.20and.20.28sub.29directly.20irreducible.20spectrum) is the most difficult to determine.

- Law 14 and commutativity ⇔ totally-symmetric quasigroup [law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492).
- Law 14 and existence of a two-sided unit ⇔ semi-symmetric loop [law 887](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?887).
- Law 14 and idempotence ⇔ Mendelsohn quasigroup [law 4961](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4961).
- Law 14 and associativity ⇔ [law 895](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?895) characterizing abelian groups of exponent 2.

Twisted versions of law 14: [law 66](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?66), [law 692](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?692), [law 695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?695), [law 880](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?880), [law 978](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?978), [law 1073](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1073), [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1492), [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1496), [law 1695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1695), [law 1719](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1719).

The number of magmas of size n (modulo isomorphisms) satisfying this law is the [OEIS sequence A076017](https://oeis.org/A076017), whose asymptotics appear unknown.
