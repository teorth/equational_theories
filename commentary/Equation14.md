## A 2001 Putnam law

Problem A1 of the 2001 Putnam asked to show that [Equation 14 implies Equation 29](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#14_implies_29). In fact, this law is equivalent to [Equation 29](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?29).

As discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Thoughts.20and.20impressions.20thread/near/493637245.2E01), Putnam magmas are related to Steiner triple systems; in particular, there is a one-to-one correspondence between commutative idempotent Putnam magmas and Steiner triple systems (the triples {x,y,z} being such that x*y=z).  Without commutativity, idempotent Putnam magmas correspond to [Mendelsohn directed triple systems](https://ajc.maths.uq.edu.au/pdf/71/ajc_v71_p485.pdf).
