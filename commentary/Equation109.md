This law implies that squares are right units ([law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) `x = x◇(y◇y)`), and states that their right cosets also consist of right units.  It cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).
