## A variant of the central groupoid law

This law bears some similarity with the central groupoid law, [Equation 168](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?168).  It is discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.202126). It is not confluent, but still has a complete rewriting system, permitting one to determine all the implications from this law.
