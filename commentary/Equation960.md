This law implies that left multiplications are bijective.  The product of any two right multiplications is a constant map (namely `(z◇x)◇y = (w◇x)◇y`).

The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and cubing maps `B: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` and `C: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` are bijections of order 3 with `S(x)=B(x)` and `x = B(C(x)) = C(B(x)) = B(B(B(x))) = C(C(C(x)))`.

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys [law 653](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?653), `x = x : (y : ((z : y) : x))`.  Conversely if a magma satisfies law 653 and left multiplications are bijective, then left division obeys law 960.  Thus, the laws 960 and 653 are parastrophically equivalent for (left-)quasigroups.
