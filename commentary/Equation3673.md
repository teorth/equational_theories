This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

On the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}`, the operation `◇` obeys the [left unar law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38), namely it is left projection composed with squaring.  The set of squares is a submagma of `P` and the operation reduces to left projection.
