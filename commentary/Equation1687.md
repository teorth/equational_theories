The free magma with one generator `x` for this law is isomorphic to `ℤ/2ℤ` equipped with `x◇y = y+1`.  Thus in any magma this law implies the [trivial left cubing law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x◇(x◇x) = x`, the [involutive squaring law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151) `(x◇x)◇(x◇x) = x`, and [law 359](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?359) `x◇x = (x◇x)◇x`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
