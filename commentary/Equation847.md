This law states that products of the form `(x◇x)◇(x◇_)` are right units.  This implies that both right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` and squared squares `(x◇x)◇(x◇x)` are right units.  In particular the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
