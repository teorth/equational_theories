This law implies that the squaring and left cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` are inverse bijections, but also that the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is a bijection, as well as all fourth-power and fifth-power maps.

Despite these numerous relations between powers, the free magma with one generator is infinite.  It admits for instance as a quotient the model on integers given by `(3k+i) ◇ (3l+j) = 3k + i + (j-i+1 smod 3)` for `0 ≤ i,j ≤ 2`, where `smod` denotes a signed modulo operation taking values `-1,0,1`.  Indeed, `x ◇ y ∈ {x-1, x, x+1}` so `(x◇y)◇(z◇(w◇x)) ∈ {x-2,x-1,x,x+1,x+2}` and `w◇x ≡ x+1` modulo 3 so `(x◇y)◇(z◇(w◇x)) ≡ x` modulo 3, which implies law 1465.  The squaring and left cubing maps are `x ↦ x+1` and `x ↦ x-1`.

In any linear model, any submagma generated by a single element is either `ℤ/6ℤ` equipped with `x◇y = 3x+4y-1`, or a quotient of it.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
