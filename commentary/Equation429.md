In left quasigroups (magmas whose left multiplications are bijective) this law implies that the left division operation defined by `x â—‡ (x : y) = y` satisfies [law 473](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?473), `x = y : (x:(y:(x:x))`.  Conversely, in left quasigroups satisfying law 473, left division satisfies 429.  Thus, laws 429 and 473 are parastrophically equivalent for (left-)quasigroups.
