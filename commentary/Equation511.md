While this law implies very few other laws, it has a surprisingly large (but finite) [number of "local" consequences](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/1076.20!.3D.3E.203/near/477475464).  This makes it possible, but extremely tedious, to construct infinite models for this law by a greedy argument - currently the proofs here require a significant SAT-solver calculation!

See also [Equation 118](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?118) for a law with similar behavior.

In finite magmas, or if left multiplications are assumed to be bijective, it is equivalent to [law 714](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?714) and [law 2338](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2338).
