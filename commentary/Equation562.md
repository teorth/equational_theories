This law states that `L(y) ∘ L(z)` is involutive for all `y,z`, where `L(z) : x ↦ z ◇ x` is left multiplication.  In particular, left multiplications are bijective.  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies the same law, `x = y : (z : (y : (z : x)))`.

Commutative magmas satisfying this law are the same as magmas satisfying [law 556](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?556).
