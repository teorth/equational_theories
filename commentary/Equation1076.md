## An "Asterix"-like equation

A variant of the ["Asterix" equation, 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65), which [also admits nontrivial infinite models that can be used to produce anti-implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1076.20!.3D.3E.203/near/476293108).

For finite magmas this law implies that the magma operation is idempotent, but not for infinite magmas.  The free magma with one single generator for this law thus has no finite quotient other than the singleton.
