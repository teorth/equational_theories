This law implies that the submagma `P = {x ◇ y | x, y ∈ M}` is a left quasigroup (left multiplications are bijective) and moreover for any `x∈M` left multiplication by `x` is a bijection of `P`.  All squares are left units in `P`.  In particular the squaring map `S: x ↦ x ◇ x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.

Magmas satisfying this law obey a very weak associativity property, law 931351, `x ◇ ((y ◇ z) ◇ w) = ((x ◇ y) ◇ z) ◇ w`, whose free magma can be described in terms of lists of lists of generators.
