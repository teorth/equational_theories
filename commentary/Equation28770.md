## An Austin law

[Kisielewicz showed](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#Kisielewicz2) that this law is an Austin law: [it has no non-trivial finite models, but it has an infinite model](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-model-chapter.html#kis-thm2). He also showed there is no shorter Austin law.
