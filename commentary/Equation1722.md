In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, law 1925 (dual of law 1722) is equivalent to [law 910](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?910) and equivalent to [law 504](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?504).  Without such assumptions, law 910 implies law 504 and law 1925, but no other implication holds.

This law implies that right multiplications are injective.

This law is a twist of [law 229](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?229) by the squaring map.
