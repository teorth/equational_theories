This law is equivalent to the [law 329](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?329) `x◇y = x◇(z◇y)` together with [law 375](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?375) (a weakened idempotence property).

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma with one generator `x` for this law is a two-element magma `{x,x◇x}`.
