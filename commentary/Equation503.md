## A mysterious "twinned" equation.

In left quasigroups (bijective left multiplications), this law is parastrophically equivalent to [law 476](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?476) in the sense that the left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` obeys law 476 if and only if `◇` obeys law 503, as observed in [this discussion thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/483169215).

In addition, this equation is "twinned" with the same [law 503](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?503), in that it [seems to](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Numerical.20coincidence.3A.20476.20~.20503) imply, and be implied by, exactly the same set of equations, without being equivalent.  This is only partially explained by parastrophic equivalence.  See [this further discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Twin.20pairs.20of.20equations).

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.  Finite magmas are thus left quasigroups.
