This law implies [the involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), `x = y◇(y◇x)`.  In particular, left cubing is the identity (`x◇(x◇x) = x`).  The squaring and right cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` obey `C(S(x)) = x` hence `S` is injective and `C` is surjective.

The equivalent [law 2000](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2000) is discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Hard.20problems.20and.20negative.20results).  The dual of law 2000, [law 1659](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1659), is [discussed here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.202126). Modified translation-invariant magmas are useful for these models.

For finite magmas, the laws [1096](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1096), [1133](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1133), and [1167](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1167) are equivalent.  Without the finiteness assumption, law 1096 implies the other two (and is in fact equivalent to their conjunction), but no other implication holds.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
