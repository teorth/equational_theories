This law is a twist of [law 323](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?323) by the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`.

For a given squaring map `S`, this law states a consistency condition between pairs of left multiplication maps (by `x` and by `S(x)`).

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same left unit element `e`, namely `e◇x = x`.
