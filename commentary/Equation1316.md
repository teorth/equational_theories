A magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) in which the square of left multiplication and the square of right division are inverses of each other.

This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 707](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?707) and [law 2940](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2940).  In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, these three laws individually are equivalent.  Without such assumptions, law 1316 implies 707 and its dual 2940, but no other implication holds.

This law is part of a series of laws that state that the magma is a quasigroup in which some j-th power of right multiplication is the inverse of some k-th power of left multiplication.  For `j=1` one has the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) for `k=1`, [law 125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125) for `k=2`, [law 714](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?714) for `k=3`, law 5974 for `k=4`, and so on.  For each `k>1`, there exist two weaker laws that are equivalent to it in the finite case or in quasigroups.  For `j=k=2` one has [law 1316](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1316).
