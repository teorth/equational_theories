A magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) in which the square of left multiplication and the square of right division are inverses of each other.

This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 707](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?707) and [law 2940](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2940).  In finite magmas, or when left multiplications are assumed to be bijective, these three laws are equivalent.
