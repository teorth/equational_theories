## Tarski's axiom

This law was identified by Tarski [1] as the law for abelian groups; the models are precisely abelian groups with the subtraction operation `x ◇ y = x - y`.  This is the shortest possible law with this property [2].

Besides law 543 and its dual, the other equivalent characterizations of minimal order are law 928, `x = y ◇ ((y◇z) ◇ (x◇z))`, identified by [Sholander](https://doi.org/10.2307/2310005), law 952 `x = y ◇ ((z◇x) ◇ (z◇y))`, identified by [Higman and Neumann](https://doi.org/10.5486/PMD.1952.2.3-4.10), and their duals.  The fact that there are no others was shown by [Padmanabhan](https://doi.org/10.1017/S144678870000570X).
