The dual of this law has appeared under the name of [pentagonal law](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06635).  Its idempotent linear models involve primitive tenth roots of unity.

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.  If left multiplications are bijective (e.g., in finite magmas) then the left division operation `x : y` defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys the same law 474.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial semigroup (associative magma).

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law [is the set `{1,3}∪[5,+∞)`](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
