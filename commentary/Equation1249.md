This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a quasigroup this law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and the map `σ` defined by `x◇σ(x) = x` are bijective, and the law then states a twisted version of the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14), namely `σ(x) = (S(y)◇x)◇y`.
