In left quasigroups, the left division operation defined by `xâ—‡(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 510](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?510) `x = y:(y:(y:(x:x)))`, and conversely, so these laws are parastrophically equivalent in left quasigroups.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
