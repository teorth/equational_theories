In left quasigroups, this law holds if and only if the left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 510](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?510) `x = y:(y:(y:(x:x)))`, namely these laws are parastrophically equivalent in left quasigroups.

In a quasigroup this law implies the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
