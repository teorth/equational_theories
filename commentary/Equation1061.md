This law states that products of the form `(x◇(y◇x))◇y` are right units.  It implies that products of the form `x◇(y◇(x◇y))` (and in particular left fourth powers `x◇(x◇(x◇x))`) are right units.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to [law 1073](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1073), namely the left cube map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is an involutive morphism and the right crossed-inverse property [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273) `y◇(x◇y) = B(x)` holds.
