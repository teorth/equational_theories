This law is equivalent to [law 4505](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4505), which states that all products `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` and `(_ ◇ _) ◇ _` are equal to the same element `∞`.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of an element `∞` together with the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S` whose last two elements may not be equal unless the list consists of exactly two elements, and with the product `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]` except `[s] ◇ [t, t] = ∞`, and all other products equal to `∞`.
