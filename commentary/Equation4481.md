This law is equivalent to stating that all products `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` and `(_ ◇ _) ◇ _` are equal to the same element `∞` which is a left and right zero (`∞◇x = x◇∞ = ∞`).

It implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(x)) = ∞` and hence `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of an element `∞` together with the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ` whose last two elements may not be equal unless the list consists of exactly two elements, and with the product `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]` except `[s] ◇ [t, t] = ∞`, and all other products equal to `∞`.
