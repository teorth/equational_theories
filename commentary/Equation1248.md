This law is a twist of [law 104](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?104) by the squaring map.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same element `e` such that `x = x ◇ ((e◇x)◇x)`.
