This law implies that the squaring and left cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` are inverse bijections, but also that the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is a bijection, as well as all five fourth-power maps.  All fifth power maps except possibly `x ↦ x◇(x◇(x◇(x◇x)))` and `(x◇x)◇((x◇x)◇x)` are bijective.  For instance the inverse of `x ↦ x◇S(S(x))` is `C ∘ B`.

Despite these numerous relations between powers, the free magma with one generator is infinite.  It admits for instance as a quotient the model on integers given by `x ◇ y = y+1` if `x,y` have the same parity, and `x ◇ y = y-2` otherwise.  The squaring and left cubing maps are `x ↦ x+1` and `x ↦ x-1`.  See also the commentary of the stronger [law 1465](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1465) for another quotient.

In any linear model, any submagma generated by a single element is either `ℤ/6ℤ` equipped with `x◇y = 3x+4y-1`, or a quotient of it.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
