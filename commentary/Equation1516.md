A challenging equation, discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/1516.20-.3E.20255).  The implication to [Equation 255](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?255) is immune to linear models, translation-invariant models, and finite models, but can be refuted by a [complicated greedy construction](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/1516-chapter.html).  The implication to [Equation 1489](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1489) for finite models was resolved using the [cohomological method](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/485020624).
