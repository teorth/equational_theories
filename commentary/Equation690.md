This law implies that left multiplications are bijective and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`, iterated six times, gives the identity (namely `S(S(S(S(S(S(x))))))=x`).  The left and right cubing maps `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` and `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` are also bijections of order 6, with `B` being the inverse of `S`.

The law can be written as `x = y ◇ (x ◇ (S(y) ◇ x)`, and is thus a twist of the [Asterix law 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65) by a bijection of order 6.

The left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y)=y` satisfies the same law, `x = y : (x : ((z : y) : x))`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or (quasi)group.
