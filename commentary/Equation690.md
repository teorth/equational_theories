This law implies that left multiplications are bijective and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`, iterated six times, gives the identity (namely `S(S(S(S(S(S(x))))))=x`).  The law can be written as `x = y ◇ (x ◇ (S(y) ◇ x)`, and is thus a twist of the [Asterix law 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65) by a bijection of order 6.

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y)=y` obeys the same law, `x = y : (x : ((z : y) : x))`.
