## "Ramanujan"

Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1).  It is open whether it implies "Hardy" [917](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?917) (or the special case [817](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?817)).  However, for translation-invariant models, "Ramanujan" implies "Hardy", thanks to the surjectivity of the squaring map in this case.  This law also implies "Littlewood" [2541](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2541) All three laws also equivalent for finite models.
