## A tricky equation

Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1).  It is open whether it implies [917](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?917) (or the special case [817](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?817)).  However, for translation-invariant models, 1729 and 917 are equivalent.
