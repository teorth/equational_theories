## "Ramanujan"

Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1).  It is known (via a [complex construction](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/1323-chapter.html), first discovered to analyze [1323](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1323)) that it does not imply "Hardy" [917](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?917), but it remains open whether it implies the special case [817](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?817).  This law also implies "Littlewood" [2541](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2541). All three laws also equivalent for finite models.
