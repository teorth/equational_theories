## "Ramanujan"

Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1).  It is known (via a [complex construction](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/1323-chapter.html), first discovered to analyze [1323](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1323)) that it does not imply "Hardy" [917](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?917).  This law implies "Littlewood" [2541](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2541). All three laws are equivalent for finite models.

The proof that it implies [817](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?817) (special case of the Hardy law) was the last one to be formalized, due to its extraordinary complexity.  It required a [blueprint of nineteen](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/1729-chapter.html) custom definitions, lemmas and theorems, and accounts for roughly 10 percent of the Lean code written for the project (excluding generated code).
