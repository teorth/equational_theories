This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is surjective and the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is injective, with `S(B(x)) = x`.  It is a version of [law 25](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?25) twisted by `B`.

In a finite magma satisfying this law, squaring and cubing are bijective and this law can be rewritten as [law 4067](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4067) `x◇x = ((x◇x)◇y)◇x` together with `S(B(x))=x`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
