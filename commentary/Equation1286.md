## An equation with non-trivial linear models

Using the linear magma model `x ◇ y = ax + by`,a we produce model of this law that contradicts [Equation 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) when `a+b ≠ 1`, `b^2=-a/(a^2+1)` and `b=(2a^2+1)/(a^5+a^3)`. This can be satisfied by taking `a` to be a root of `a^5+2a^4+3a^3+3a^2+a+1`.  For instance, working in `ℤ/pℤ`, one can take `(p,a,b) = (11,1,7)`.
