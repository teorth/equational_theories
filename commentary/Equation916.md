This law implies that all left multiplications are bijective.

The free magma with one generator for this law is isomorphic to `ℤ/3ℤ` equipped with `x◇y = y+1`.  In particular, in any magma the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and cubing maps `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` and `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` are bijections of order 3 with `S(x) = C(x)` and `B(x) = S(S(x))` and `S(S(S(x))) = x`.

The magma operation is characterized by the choice of bijection `S` of order 3, and, for each orbit of `S` (either `{y}` or `{y,S(y),S(S(y))}`), of the map `x ↦ y◇S(S(x))`, which is an involution.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
