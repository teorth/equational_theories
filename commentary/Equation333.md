## A directoid law and a graphic law

Semigroups (namely associative magmas) satisfying this law are called graphic semigroups.  It implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent (`S(S(x))=S(x)`).

In a magma satisfying this law together with its dual law 377, the properties `x◇y=x` and `y◇x=x` are equivalent and define a binary relation `x ≤ y` such that `x◇y ≤ x` and `x◇y ≤ y`.  A directoid is a magma satisfying laws 333 and 377 and in which `≤` is a partial order, or equivalently satisfying the idempotence [law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) and either [law 56970](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56970) `x◇(y◇z) = (x◇(y◇z))◇z` or its dual (equivalent to transitivity of `≤`).
