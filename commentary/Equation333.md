## The left graphic law, a directoid law

The right graphic law 377 `x◇y = (x◇y)◇x` (dual to law 333) was introduced first in the context of semigroups (associative magmas) [1], and is relevant for quandles and racks appearing [in knot theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09368).  This law (or its dual) implies that `(x◇y)◇(x◇y) = x◇y`, namely the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` acts trivially on the submagma `P = {x◇y | x,y∈M}`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

In a magma satisfying this law together with its dual law 377, the properties `x◇y=x` and `y◇x=x` are equivalent and define a binary relation `x ≤ y` such that `x◇y ≤ x` and `x◇y ≤ y`.  A directoid is a magma satisfying laws 333 and 377 and in which `≤` is a partial order, or equivalently satisfying the idempotence [law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) and either [law 56970](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56970) `x◇(y◇z) = (x◇(y◇z))◇z` or its dual (equivalent to transitivity of `≤`).
