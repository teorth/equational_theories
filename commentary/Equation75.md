This law constrains each left multiplication independently.  It states that left multiplication by any given element is bijective and cubes to the identity.

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies the same law, namely `x = y : (y : (y : x))`.

This law is also called the [C₃ law](https://doi.org/10.1016/0012-365X(89)90348-8).
