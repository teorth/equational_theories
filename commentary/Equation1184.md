This law implies that the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is involutive, that left multiplications are bijective, and that left multiplications by `y` and by `B(y)` are inverses of each other ([law 1122](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1122)).

This law implies that left multiplications are bijective.  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y`  the same law.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)`.
