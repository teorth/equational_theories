The image of the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` coincides with the set `I` of idempotent elements (because `C(x)◇C(x) = C(x)` and `C` is obviously the identity map on `I`).  This set is a right ideal in the sense that `x◇y` is idempotent whenever `x` is idempotent.  Additionally, products of the form `((x◇_)◇x)◇x` are idempotent.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
