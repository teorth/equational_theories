This law implies that the magma operation is idempotent.  It cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).

It is part of a [longest chain of implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Longest.20implication.20chain/near/521750611) 2 → 4 → 1037 → 1237 → 103 → … → 1 between inequivalent laws of order up to 4.
