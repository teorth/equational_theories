This law implies that the operation `x◆y  = y◇(y◇x)` obeys [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), `x = x◆(y◆x)`.

In quasigroups (more generally if left multiplications are either all injective or all surjective), this law is equivalent to the [involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), `x = y◇(y◇x)`.
