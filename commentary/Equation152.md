This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is an involution.

It is implied by (and much weaker than) the [Sheffer stroke law 321577](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?321577).  Magmas satisfying the dual law 166 together with [law 156](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?156) were dubbed [Sheffer groupoids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12079).

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).
