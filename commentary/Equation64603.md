## A law for abelian groups of exponent 3

Laws characterizing addition in abelian groups of exponent 3, namely in ℤ/3ℤ modules, have at least order 6 and 3 variables.  The lowest-numbered one is law 64603 `x = y◇(y◇(z◇(z◇(y◇(x◇z)))))`.  There are 512 known such laws, and 570 candidates (for a maximum number of 1082 laws of that order), among which 126 are known to work for finite magmas.

The equivalence class of law 64603 also includes three laws (and their duals) which belong to infinite families of laws of order `2 n` characterizing abelian groups of exponent `n`.  These infinite families are expressed in terms of a choice of (n-1)-st power `f:x ↦ x^(n-1)` with some choice of bracketing, namely the identity map for `n=2`, squaring map `x↦x◇x` for `n=3`, one of the cubing maps `x↦x◇(x◇x)` or `x↦(x◇x)◇x` for `n=4`, etc.:

- `x = y◇((x◇z)◇f(y◇z))` gives [law 895](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?895) for `n=2` and [law 130113](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?130113) `x = y◇((x◇z)◇((y◇z)◇(y◇z)))` for `n=3`;

- `x = y◇((f(y◇z)◇x)◇z)` gives [law 1334](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1334) for `n=2` and [law 226003](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?226003) `x = y◇((((y◇z)◇(y◇z))◇x)◇z)` for `n=3`;

- `x = ((y◇x)◇z)◇f(y◇z)`, found by McCune ([Short Single Axioms for Boolean Algebra](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1020542009983), Theorem 2), gives [law 2113](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2113) for `n=2` and [law 324693](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?324693) `x = ((y◇x)◇z) ◇ ((y◇z)◇(y◇z))` for `n=3`.
