This law, analogous to the dual of [law 3308](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3308), states that left and right multiplications by `y`, namely `L(y) : x ↦ y◇x` and `R(y) : x ↦ x◇y`, obey `R(y) = L(y)∘R(y)∘R(y)`.  In finite magmas this implies `R(y) = R(y)∘L(y)∘R(y)`, namely [law 3955](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3955).

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14]((https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).
