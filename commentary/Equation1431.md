This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is injective and the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is surjective, with `B(S(x)) = x`.  It is a version of [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) twisted by `S`.

In a finite magma satisfying this law, squaring and cubing are inverse bijections, hence the `y`-independence of `S(x) ◇ (y ◇ S(x))` implies [law 4269](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4269) `x◇(y◇x) = B(x)`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
