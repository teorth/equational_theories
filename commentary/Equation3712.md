This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same left unit element `e`, namely `e◇x = x`.
