This law is equivalent to the [reduction law 327](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?327) and to [law 375](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?375) (a weakened idempotence property).  It implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x ◇ x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ` whose first element does not appear elsewhere in the list except possibly in the last position, with the product `[s, …, t] ◇ [u, …, v] = [s, …, t, u]` unless `s=t` (and the left operand is not just `[s]`), in which case `t` is deleted from the list.

In particular, the free magma with one generator `x` for this law is a two-element magma `{x,x◇x}`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
