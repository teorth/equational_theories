This law states that left and right cubes are equal, that right multiplication by squares are all equal, and that `(x ◇ _) ◇ _` only depends on `x`.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S` whose last two elements are distinct unless the list has the form `[s, s]` or `[s, s, s]`, and with the operation defined by `[s] ◇ [t, t] = [s, s, s]` and otherwise `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]`, and `[s, …, t] ◇ _ = [s, s, s]` when the first operand has at least two entries.
