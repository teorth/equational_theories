This twist of the [Asterix law 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65) by the squaring map implies that left multiplications are surjective.

Finite magmas satisfying this law are left quasigroups (left multiplications are bijective).  The left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 429](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?429), `x = x:(y:(x:(y:x)))` and the converse holds assuming that `y↦x:y` are bijective maps; thus the two laws are parastrophically equivalent for left quasigroups.
