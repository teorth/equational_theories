This law is equivalent to [law 4337](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4337) which states that all products of the form `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` and `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` are equal to the same element `e`, which is a right zero.

This law implies that the set of squares is a submagma.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(x)) = e` hence `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
