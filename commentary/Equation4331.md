This law is equivalent to [law 4337](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4337) which states that all products of the form `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` and `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` are equal to the same element `∞`.

In particular, this law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
