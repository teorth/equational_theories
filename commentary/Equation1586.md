This law implies that left multiplications are bijective.  Composing two right multiplications gives a constant map, namely `(z◇x)◇y = (w◇x)◇y`, so the magma cannot be a (non-trivial) quasigroup.

The left division operation, defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` (or equivalently `x : y = (x ◇ (x◇x)) ◇ (y◇y)`), obeys [law 860](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?860), namely `x = x : ((y : z) : (z : x))`.  Conversely, in a magma satisfying law 860 and with bijective left multiplications, the left division obeys law 1586.  Thus, the laws 1586 and 860 are parastrophically equivalent for left-quasigroups.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
