This law is equivalent to stating that left and right cubes are equal ([law 4380](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4380)), that products of the form `(_ ◇ _) ◇ x` only depend on `x` ([law 4593](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4593)), and that all left multiplications square to the same map ([law 4275](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4275), namely `y◇(y◇x)` is `y`-independent).

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
