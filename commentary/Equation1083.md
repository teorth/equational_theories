This law implies that left multiplications are surjective and right multiplications are injective.  The operation `x◆y = x◇(y◇x)` satisfies the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14)

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial semigroup (associative magma).

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [unknown](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
