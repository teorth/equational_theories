This law implies [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), namely left multiplications are involutions (in particular, bijective).  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` thus satisfies the same law.  The law also implies that the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is an involution (`C(C(x)) = x`) and that left multiplications by `x` and by `C(x)` coincide.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [totally symmetric quasigroup law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492), namely to commutativity together with the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)`.
