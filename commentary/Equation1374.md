This law implies [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), namely left multiplications are involutions (in particular, bijective).  It also implies that the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is an involution (`C(C(x)) = x`) and that left multiplications by `x` and by `C(x)` coincide.

This law implies [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), namely left multiplications are involutions (in particular, bijective).  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys the same law.
