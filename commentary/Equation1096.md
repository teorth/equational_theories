This law implies [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), namely left multiplications are involutions.  The product of any two right multiplications is a constant map (namely `(z◇x)◇y = (w◇x)◇y`).

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys the same law, `x = y : ((x : (z : y)) : x)`.
