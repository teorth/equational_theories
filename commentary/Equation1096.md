This law is equivalent to the conjunction of the [involutive left multiplication law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)` and [law 4615](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4615) (equivalent to `(z◇x)◇y = (w◇x)◇y`) which states that the product of any two right multiplications is a constant map.

The squaring and right cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` are bijections and are inverses of each other, while the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is the identity ([law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8)).

For finite magmas, the laws [1096](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1096), [1133](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1133), and [1167](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1167) are equivalent.  Without the finiteness assumption, law 1096 implies the other two (and is in fact equivalent to their conjunction), but no other implication holds.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
