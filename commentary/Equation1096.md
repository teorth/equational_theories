This law implies [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), namely left multiplications are involutions.  The product of any two right multiplications is a constant map (namely `(z◇x)◇y = (w◇x)◇y`).

For finite magmas, the laws [1096](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1096), [1133](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1133), and [1167](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1167) are equivalent.  Without the finiteness assumption, law 1096 implies the other two (and is in fact equivalent to their conjunction), but no other implication holds.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
