This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 4380](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4380) (equality of left and right cubes) and [law 4586](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4586) (which states that `(x ◇ y) ◇ z` only depends on `x`).

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
