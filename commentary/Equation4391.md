This law states that left and right cubes coincide and that, denoting `P = {x ◇ y | x, y ∈ M}`, the operation restricted to `P × M` is right projection composed with cubing.  The operation restricted to `(M∖P) × M` is only constrained to reproduce this cubing map.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
