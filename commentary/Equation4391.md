This law states that left and right cubes coincide and that, denoting `P = {x ◇ y | x, y ∈ M}`, the operation restricted to `P × M` is right projection composed with cubing.  The operation restricted to `(M∖P) × M` is only constrained to reproduce this cubing map.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S⊔{∞}` that do not have `∞` in last or next-to-last positions, and do not have consecutive `∞`, with the operation defined by `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]`, and `[s, …, t] ◇ [u] = [u, u, u]`, and `[s, …, t] ◇ [u, …, v] = [∞, u, …, v]` if `u≠∞` and both operands have at least two entries, and `[s, …, t] ◇ [∞, u, …, v] = [∞, u, …, v]`.
