A "mirror image" of "Ramanujan" [1729](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1729), discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/1323).  The implication to 2274 was immune to linear models, translation-invariant models, and finite models; however, it was [finally refuted](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/1323-chapter.html) by a hybrid model which was partially linear and partially greedy.
