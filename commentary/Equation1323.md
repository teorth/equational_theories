A "mirror image" of "Ramanujan" [1729](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1729), discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/1323).

Law 1323 implies that left multiplications are surjective and right multiplications are injective.

For finite magmas, or for quasigroups, law 1323, [law 1526](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1526), and [law 2744](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2744) are equivalent.  Without these assumptions, law 1323 implies law 1526 but no other implication holds.

The implication to 2744 was immune to linear models, translation-invariant models, and finite models; however, it was [finally refuted](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/1323-chapter.html) by a hybrid model which was partially linear and partially greedy.

The laws 1323, 1526, 2744 are twists of laws [125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125), [73](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?73), [229](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?229) by the squaring map.
