This law is equivalent to the equality of left and right cubes and to the left and right crossed inverse properties [law 4588](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4588) and [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273).

It implies that the set of cubes is a submagma.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).
