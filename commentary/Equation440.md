## A right-unit fourth-powers law

This law states that the powers `y◇(y◇(y◇y))` are right units.

The analogues for squares, left cubes and right cubes are [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11), [law 56](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56) and [law 108](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?108), and for different fourth powers are law 440, [law 643](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?643), [law 846](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?846), [law 1049](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1049), and [law 1252](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1252).

In a left quasigroup this law implies that all `y◇(y◇(y◇y))` are equal to the same element `e` and `x=x◇e`.  It is equivalent to stating that the left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys [law 414](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?414) `x = x : (x:(x:(y:y)))`, namely laws 414 and 440 are parastrophically equivalent.
