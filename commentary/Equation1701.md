## A law with an interesting infinite model

A relative of [Equation 1661](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1661).  As [discussed in this thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1661.20-.3E.201657.20-.20another.20one.20bites.20the.20dust), this law has  interesting infinite models on the natural numbers that can be used to generate a number of non-trivial anti-implications. The models are more difficult to construct than was the case with 1661.
