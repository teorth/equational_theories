## A law with many finite implications and an interesting infinite model

A relative of [Equation 1661](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1661).  As [discussed in this thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1661.20-.3E.201657.20-.20another.20one.20bites.20the.20dust), this law has interesting infinite models on the natural numbers that can be used to generate a number of non-trivial anti-implications. The models are more difficult to construct than was the case with 1661.

This law is very similar to [law 2093](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2093) `x = ((z◇x)◇x) ◇ (y◇x)` (dual to law 1443) and similarly has many independent finite implications.  Law 1701 implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and the map `f: x ↦ (y◇x)◇x` for arbitrary `y` obeys `S(f(x)) = x` (hence `S` is surjective and `f` injective).  In a finite magma the structure simplifies: `(y◇x)◇x` is `y`-independent and equal to the right-cube `B(x) = (x◇x)◇x`.  The squaring and cubing maps `S` and `B` are then inverse bijections.  Under these conditions law 1701 reduces to [law 1681](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1681) `x = (y◇x)◇B(x)`, which can be recast (using `B(S(x))=x`) as [law 3877](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3877) `S(x) = (y◇S(x))◇x`.  On the other hand, `(y◇S(x))◇S(x) = B(S(x)) = x` ([law 1884](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1884)) holds, hence [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x◇S(x) = x` as well.  Combining laws 8 and 3877 yields [law 1035](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1035) `x = x ◇ ((y◇S(x))◇x)`.
