Among magmas whose left multiplication maps are injective, this law is equivalent to [law 31](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?31) stating that squares are left units.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same left unit element `e`, namely `eâ—‡x = x`.
