## A right-unit fourth-powers law

This law states that the powers `(y◇y)◇(y◇y)` are right units.  These powers can be written as `S(S(y))` for `S: x ↦ x◇x` the squaring map, so one has `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The analogues for squares, left cubes and right cubes are [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11), [law 56](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56) and [law 108](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?108), and for different fourth powers are [law 440](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?440), [law 643](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?643), law 846, [law 1049](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1049), and [law 1252](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1252).
