A magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) in which right division is the square of left multiplication.

This law and [law 73](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?73) and [law 229](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?229) are equivalent for finite magmas, or when left multiplications are bijective.  Without such assumptions, law 125 implies law 73 and law 229, but no other implication holds.

The operation `x◆y = (x◇y)◇x` satisfies the [Dupont law 63](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?63) and [Dupond law 1692](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1692).  This defines a one-to-one correspondence between quasigroups satisfying law 125 and law 63, with the inverse being `x◇y = y◆(y◆x)`.  The inequivalent laws 63 and 125 share the same finite spectrum.
