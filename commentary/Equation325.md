This law was dubbed [paragraphic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09368).  In a flexible magma, namely one satisfying [law 4435](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4435), this law is equivalent to the [right graphic law 377](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?377).

This law cannot hold in any non-trivial quasigroup.
