## Dual of a 1978 Putnam law

Its dual [Equation 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?381) is connected to [Equation 3722](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3722) and [Equation 3744](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3744).  Problem A4 of the 1978 Putnam asked to show (in our language) that [Equation 3744 implies Equations 3722 and 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#3744_implies_3722_381).
