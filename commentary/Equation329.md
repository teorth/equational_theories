## Dual of a 1978 Putnam law

Its dual [Equation 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?381) is connected to [Equation 3722](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3722) and [Equation 3744](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3744).  Problem A4 of the 1978 Putnam asked to show (in our language) that [Equation 3744 implies Equations 3722 and 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#3744_implies_3722_381).

Consider the equivalence relation `x ∼ y` when right multiplications by these two elements coincide.  Right multiplication by `x` takes values in the equivalence class of `x`.  Magmas satisfying this law are in one to one correspondence with partitions of the underlying set `M`, together with one map from `M` to each of the parts of the partition.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ` equipped with the operation `[s1, …, sn] ◇ [t1, …, tm] = [s1, …, sn, tm]`.
