This law implies that all left multiplications square to constant maps ([law 4268](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4268), namely `x◇(x◇y)` is `y`-independent) and left multiplications by squares are all equal ([law 4590](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4590)).

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
