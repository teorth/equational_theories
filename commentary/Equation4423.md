This law implies that all left multiplications square to constant maps ([law 4268](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4268), namely `x◇(x◇y)` is `y`-independent) and left multiplications by squares are all equal ([law 4590](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4590)).

This law implies that the set of squares is a submagma and the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is such that `S(S(x))` is a constant.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
