This law states that the operation `x◆y = x◇(y◇x)` obeys [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10), namely `x = x◆(y◆x)`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to [law 1073](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1073), namely the left cube map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is an involutive morphism and the right crossed-inverse property [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273) `y◇(x◇y) = B(x)` holds.
