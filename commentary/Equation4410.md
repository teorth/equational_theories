This law is equivalent to stating that products of the form `x ◇ (x ◇ y)` and `(x ◇ x) ◇ y` are all equal to the same element `e` which is a left and right zero.

This law implies that the set of squares is a right ideal (with `S(x)◇y = e`) and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`  `S(S(x)) = e` hence `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
