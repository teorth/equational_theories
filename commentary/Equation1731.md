This law states that left multiplication by any square is an involution.  It is a twist of [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)` by the squaring map `S:x ↦ x◇x`, and is equivalent to it when `S` is surjective.

The [half-group law 3737](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3737) `x◇y = (x◇z) ◇ (y◇z)`, together with either one of law 1731 or the stronger [law 1718](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1718) `x = (y◇y) ◇ ((x◇x)◇x)`, characterizes the group division operation `x◇y = x y⁻¹`.
