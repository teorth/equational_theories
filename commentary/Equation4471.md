This law states that `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` and `(x ◇ x) ◇ y` only depend on `x` and are equal.

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The magma admits at least one left zero element.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
