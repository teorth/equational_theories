## The boolean algebra Sheffer stroke law

The equivalent laws 321577 `x = ((y◇z)◇x) ◇ (y ◇((y◇x)◇y))`, 329857 `x = ((y◇z)◇x) ◇ ((y◇(y◇x))◇y)`, and their duals 361729 and 345169, characterize the [Sheffer stroke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffer_stroke) in Boolean algebras.  This was found in 2000 by Wolfram and by McCune and Veroff, see [this discussion on credit](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/A.20single.20axiom.20for.20Boolean.20algebra/with/519534424).  These laws appear to be the only characterizations as laws of order 6 with three variables.

We [explain here](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#sheffer) the equivalence for law 345169.
