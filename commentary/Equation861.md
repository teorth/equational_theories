This law states that products of the form `(x◇y)◇(y◇x)`, and in particular fourth powers `(x◇x)◇(x◇x)`, are right units.  Thus, the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the existence of a right unit `e` such that `e◇(x◇y) = y◇x` and `y◇(e◇y) = e`.  In particular, `e◇(e◇y) = y`.
