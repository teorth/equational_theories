This law states that the squaring map `S:x ↦ x◇x` is bijective and composing it four times gives the identity (`S(S(S(S(x))))=x`), and that all left multiplications cube to the inverse of `S` (and in particular are bijective).

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies [law 439](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?439) `x : (y : (y : (y : x))) = x`.
