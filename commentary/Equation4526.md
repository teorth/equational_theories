This law implies the [associative law 4512](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4512).  It is equivalent to law 4582 `x◇(y◇z) = (w◇u)◇v` which states that all triple products are the same element `∞`, which is a left and right zero (`∞◇x = x◇∞ = ∞`).

Denoting by `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}`, the magma is characterized by the pointed set `(P,∞)`, the set `M∖P`, and an external operation `(M∖P)×(M∖P) → P`.

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law is `Σ ⊔ Σ×Σ ⊔ {∞}`, on which `s◇t=(s,t)` and every other product is `∞`.

The equivalence class of this law is large (14 laws in our list of 4694 laws).

The weaker [law 4274](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4274) states constancy of only one set of triple products.
