This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(x)`.  It also implies that the set of squares `im(S)` is a left ideal (hence a submagma) with the [right unar law 39](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?39) `x◇s = s◇s` for `s∈im(S)`.  In particular the left cubes are squared squares, `x◇(x◇x) = S(S(x))`.  Right cubes are also squares as `(x◇x)◇x = S(x◇((x◇x)◇x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
