This law is equivalent to the conjunction of the [left crossed inverse property 4588](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4588) and of the equality of left and right cubes.

It implies that the set of cubes is a submagma.

In a quasigroup, this law is simply equivalent to the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)`.
