This law implies the [unipotent law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40): all squares are equal to the same idempotent element `e`.  In addition, `x ◇ (x ◇ e) = e` for all `x`.

In quasigroups (more generally when left multiplications are injective) this law is equivalent to [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) `x = x◇(y◇y)`, and equivalently all squares are equal to the same element, which is a right unit.
