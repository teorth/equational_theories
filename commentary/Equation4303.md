This law implies [law 4300](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4300) stating that left multiplication by a product is a constant map.  In addition, this constant is the same for left multiplication by `x◇y` and by `y◇x`.  The subset `P={x◇y|x,y∈M}` is a left ideal, hence a submagma, that obeys the [right unar law 39](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?39).

The set of squares `x◇x`, the set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`, and the set of right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` are submagmas of `P`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
