This law is equivalent to the equality of left and right cubes `B(y) = y◇(y◇y) = (y◇y)◇y`, together with the fact that left multiplications all square to `B`, and that `(x◇y)◇x = B(y)`.  The set of cubes is a submagma.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together with the [involutive left multiplication law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)`.
