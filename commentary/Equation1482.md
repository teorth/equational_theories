This twist of [law 167](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?167) by the squaring map was among the last few (of order up to 4) for which the [full spectrum question](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Equations.20with.20full.20spectrum/near/489997789) was resolved: it has models of all finite sizes, but not necessarily linear ones.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial semigroup (associative magma).

In a quasigroup, this law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is bijective.
