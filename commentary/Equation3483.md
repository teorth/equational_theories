This law implies the [right-zero unipotence law 316](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?316): all squares are equal to an element `e` that is a right zero, namely `x ◇ e = e`.  In addition, all products of the form `x ◇ ((x ◇ _) ◇ _)` are equal to `e`, for instance right cubes `(x◇x)◇x = e◇x` form a left ideal.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
