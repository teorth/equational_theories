This law implies that squares are right units ([law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11), `x = x◇(y◇y)`).

If a right multiplication map `R(y): x ↦ x◇y` has a fixed point then `R(y)` is the identity map.  In other words, `x◇y=x` implies `z◇y=z`.

In left quasigroups, this law is equivalent to [law 508](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?508), itself equivalent to law 11 and the [involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)`.  Together, these imply that all squares are equal to the same element ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)), which is a right unit.  Equivalently, the left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` is commutative and admits a (two-sided) unit element.
