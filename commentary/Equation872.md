This law implies that left multiplications are surjective and the right cubing map `C:x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is surjective, with `C((x◇x)◇C(x)) = x`, so the map `x ↦ (x◇x)◇((x◇x)◇x)` is injective.

In a quasigroup, this law implies [law 23](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?23), `C(x) = x`.
