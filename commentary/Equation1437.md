This law implies [law 1431](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1431) `x = (x◇x)◇(y◇(x◇x))`, a twisted version of [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) that implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is injective and the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is surjective, with `B(S(x)) = x`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
