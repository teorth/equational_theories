This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 385](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?385) `x ◇ y = (y ◇ x) ◇ y`, and the ["right-zero product" law 343](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?343) `x ◇ y = z ◇ (x ◇ y)` which states that all products are right zeros.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S`, with the operation `[s, …, t] ◇ [u, …, v] = [u, …, v]` when the second operand has more than one item, and otherwise `[s, …, t] ◇ [u] = [s, …, t, u]` except in the special case `[s, t] ◇ [s] = [t, s]`.
