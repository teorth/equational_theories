## The left-involutive and unital law

This law is equivalent to the conjunction of three laws of order 2: the [involutive left-multiplication law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)`, together with any two among the [right-unit squares law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) `x = x◇(y◇y)`, its dual law 25, and the [unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11).  It is also equivalent to law 16 together with the existence of a two-sided unit.  See [this Zulip thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Search.20space.20for.20.28EqX.20.E2.88.A7.20EqY.29.20.E2.86.92.20EqZ/with/540693714).

The equivalence class of this law contains 39 laws of order 6 (which is the minimum) as well as 12 laws that are only known to be equivalent for finite models.  The lowest-numbered ones are
- Law 68386 `x = y ◇ (y ◇ (x ◇ (z ◇ ((z ◇ z) ◇ z))))` for finite magmas;
- Law 68410 `x = y ◇ (y ◇ (x ◇ (z ◇ ((w ◇ w) ◇ z))))`;
- Law 80806 `x = y ◇ (y ◇ (x ◇ (((z ◇ z) ◇ z) ◇ z)))`.
