This law implies that right multiplications square to constant maps (namely `(y◇x)◇x = (x◇x)◇x` is `y`-independent), and that left multiplications are bijections whose square is the left cubing map (namely `y◇(y◇x) = x◇(x◇x)`).

The free magma with one generator for this law is isomorphic to `ℤ/3ℤ` equipped with `x◇y = y+1`.  In particular, in any magma the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and cubing maps `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` and `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` are bijections of order 3 with `S(x) = C(x)` and `B(x) = S(S(x))` and `S(S(S(x))) = x`.

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys the same law, `x = y : (y : ((z : x) : x))`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or (quasi)group.
