## A law for abelian groups of exponent 2

An equivalent form of [1571](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1571), known to characterize the operation in abelian groups of exponent 2.  In particular, it implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) and [associative law 4512](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4512).

Since division coincides with multiplication for groups of exponent 2, the law also implies Tarski's axiom [543](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?543).
