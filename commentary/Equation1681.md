This law implies that the squaring and right-cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `B: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` obey `S(B(x)) = x` (hence `S` is surjective and `B` injective).  In a finite magma, `B` and `S` are inverse bijections and law 1681 `x = (y◇x)◇B(x)` can be recast as [law 3877](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3877) `S(x) = (y◇S(x))◇x`.
