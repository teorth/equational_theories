This law implies that the squaring and right-cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` obey `S(C(x)) = x` (hence `S` is surjective and `C` injective).  In a finite magma, `C` and `S` are inverse bijections and law 1681 `x = (y◇x)◇C(x)` can be recast as [law 3877](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3877) `S(x) = (y◇S(x))◇x`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
