This law is a twist of [law 9](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?9) by the squaring map.

In quasigroups (more generally when left multiplications are injective), this law is equivalent to [the right-unit squares law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11), which in that context is equivalent to stating that squares are all equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same right unit.
