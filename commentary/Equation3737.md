## The group division law among quasigroups

As proven by Polonijo [1], a quasigroup satisfying this law is a Ward quasigroup, namely a group equipped with the division operation.  On its own, this order-4 law does not imply the quasigroup property, namely that left and right multiplications are bijective.  To characterize group division among *all* magmas, one needs the [Higman–Neumann axiom](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?42323216), of order 8.

This law is also called [right transivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0991).
