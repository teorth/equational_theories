## The group division law among quasigroups

As proven by [Stein in 1957](https://doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9947-1957-0094404-6), a quasigroup satisfying this law is a group equipped with the division operation (a Ward quasigroup).  On its own, this order-4 law does not imply the quasigroup property, namely that left and right multiplications are bijective.  To characterize group division among *all* magmas, one needs the [Higman–Neumann axiom](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?42323216), of order 8.

This law is also called [right transivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0991).

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.
