This law states that left multiplication by any given element is a map that cubes to itself.

In quasigroups (more generally when left multiplications are injective) this law is equivalent to [the involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)`.
