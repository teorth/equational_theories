This law implies [law 23](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?23) `x=(x◇x)◇x`.  It is a twist of [law 53](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?53) by the squaring map.

In a quasigroup (more generally if left multiplications are injective), this law is equivalent to the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)`.
