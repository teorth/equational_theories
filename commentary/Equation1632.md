This law is a twist of [law 102](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?102) by the squaring map.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to `(x◇y)◇y = C(x)` together with the one-variable [law 1629](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1629) `x = (x◇x) ◇ ((x◇x)◇x)`.
