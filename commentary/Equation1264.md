This law states that products of the form `((x◇y)◇x)◇y` are right units.  It implies [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) (squares are right units).

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same two-sided unit element.
