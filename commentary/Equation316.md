## The right-zero unipotence law

This law states that all squares are equal to the same element `e` that is a right zero, namely `xâ—‡e=e`.  It is equivalent to the [right zeropotence law 312](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?312) together with equality of squares, [law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40).

This law cannot hold in any non-trivial quasigroup.
