Law 1526 implies that right multiplications are injective.

For finite magmas, or for quasigroups, [law 1323](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1323), law 1526, and [law 2744](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2744) are equivalent.  Without these assumptions, law 1323 implies law 1526 but no other implication holds.

This law implies that right multiplications are injective.

The laws 1323, 1526, 2744 are twists of laws [125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125), [73](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?73), [229](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?229) by the squaring map.
