Law 1526 implies that right multiplications are injective.

For finite magmas, or for quasigroups, [law 1323](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1323), law 1526, and [law 2744](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2744) are equivalent.  Without these assumptions, law 1323 implies law 1526 but no other implication holds.
