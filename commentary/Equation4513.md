This law implies the [associative law 4512](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4512).

For a magma `M` obeying this law, the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` obeys [law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38), namely its operation is left-projection composed with some function.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is `S ⊔ S×S×{0,1}`, with the magma operation `s◇t=(s,t,0)`, `s◇(t,_,_)=(s,t,1)`, `(s,t,_)◇_=(s,t,1)`, `(s,t,_)◇(_,_,_)=(s,t,1)`.
