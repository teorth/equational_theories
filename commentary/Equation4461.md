This law states that left and right cubes are equal, that left multiplications by squares are all equal to that cubing map, and that `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` only depends on `y` (the right crossed-inverse property [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273)).

It implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`  `S(S(x)) = S(S(y))` and `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [semi-symmetric loop law 887](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?887) and in particular all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same two-sided unit element.
