This law states that left and right cubes are equal, that left multiplications by squares are all equal to that cubing map, and that `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` only depends on `y` (the right crossed-inverse property [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273)).

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
