## The modular ortholattice Sheffer stroke law

It was shown by [McCune, Padmanabhan, Rose, Veroff](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00012-004-1902-0) that a magma operation satisfies this law if and only if it is the Sheffer stroke of a modular ortholattice.

This is an order 11 law with four variables.  It is not known whether there exist equivalent laws of lower order or number of variables.
