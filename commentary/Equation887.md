This law is equivalent to the Putnam [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) together with the existence of a two-sided identity element `e`.  All squares are equal to that element `x ◇ x = e`.

Magmas that satisfy this law are in one-to-one correspondence with Mendelsohn triple systems with one fewer element (the identity), with `x ◇ y = z` precisely when `x,y,z` form a triple.

Magmas that satisfy this law together with the commutative [law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) are called sloops.
