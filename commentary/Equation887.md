## The semi-symmetric loop law

This law is equivalent to the Putnam [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) together with the existence of a two-sided identity element `e`.  All squares are equal to that element `x ◇ x = e`.

Magmas `M` that satisfy this law are in one-to-one correspondence with [Mendelsohn directed triple systems](https://ajc.maths.uq.edu.au/pdf/71/ajc_v71_p485.pdf) on `M∖{e}`, with `x ◇ y = z` precisely when `x,y,z` form a triple.  A different correspondence identifies these systems to Mendelsohn quasigroups (magmas satisfying [law 4961](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4961)) by taking instead `x ◇ x = x`, with no unit element.

Magmas that satisfy this law together with the commutative [law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) are called sloops (Steiner loops) and are characterized by [law 63702](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?63702).

The free magma with one generator `x` for this law is a two-element magma `{x,x◇x}`.
