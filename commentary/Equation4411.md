This law is equivalent to stating that both `x ◇ (x ◇ _)` and `(_ ◇ _) ◇ x` are equal to the same (cubing) function `C(x)`.

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas, and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(x)) = S(S(y))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
