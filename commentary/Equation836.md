This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a quasigroup, this law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` are bijections, and that `(y◇x)◇S(y)` only depends on `x`, which is a twist of the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) (equivalent to `x = (y◇x)◇y`).
