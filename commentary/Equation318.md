This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S` equipped with the operation `[s1, …, sn] ◇ [t] = [s1, …, sn, t]` when the second operand has a single entry, and otherwise `_ ◇ [t1, …, tm] = [tm, tm]`.
