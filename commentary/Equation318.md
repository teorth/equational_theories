This law implies the [right zeropotence law 312](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?312), namely the squares are right-zeros.

This law cannot hold in any non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ` equipped with the operation `[s1, …, sn] ◇ [t] = [s1, …, sn, t]` when the second operand has a single entry, and otherwise `_ ◇ [t1, …, tm] = [tm, tm]`.
