This law implies [law 3262](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3262) `x◇(y◇(y◇y)) = x◇x` which implies that the set of left cubes `y◇(y◇y)` forms a submagma (in fact, a left ideal) satisfying the [left unar law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38) `s◇t = s◇s`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
