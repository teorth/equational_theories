This law states that products of the form `(x◇(x◇y))◇y` are right units.  It implies that squares are right units ([law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11)).

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [right unit squares law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) `x = x◇(y◇y)` together with the [involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)`.  In particular, all squares are equal.
