## A twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law

A magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective).  The cubing maps `B: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` and `C: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` are automorphism and inverses of each other.  The magma obeys the middle crossed inverse property `C(y)◇(x◇y)=x` or equivalently `(C(y)◇x)◇y=x`.  A more symmetrical way to state these facts is that for any three elements `x,y,z` of the magma the equations `x◇y=z`, `C(y)◇z=x`, and `z◇B(x)=y` are equivalent.

In short, this law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)` by an automorphism.  Analogous twists of law 14 include [law 66](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?66), [law 692](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?692), [law 695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?695), [law 880](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?880), [law 978](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?978), [law 1073](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1073), [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1492), [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1496), [law 1695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1695), [law 1719](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1719).

This law differs from law 1492 by the exchange of `B` and `C`.  It is implied by law 692, as well as by law 695, which are twists of law 14.
