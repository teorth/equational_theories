This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.

In quasigroups (more generally when left multiplications are injective) this law is equivalent to [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x = x◇(x◇x)` together with [law 427](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?427) `x = x◇(y◇(x◇(x◇y)))`.
