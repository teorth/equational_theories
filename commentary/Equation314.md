This law is equivalent to stating that all squares and all three-fold products of the form `_ ◇ (_ ◇ _)` are equal to the same element.

See also [law 4274](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4274) which implies that three-fold products `_ ◇ (_ ◇ _)` are all equal.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is the set of finite lists of elements of `S` (including the empty list `[]`), where `[s1, ..., sn] ◇ [s] = [s1, ..., sn, s]` except for two special cases `[] ◇ [s] = [s, s]` and `[s] ◇ [s] = []`, and all other products (with a second operand of length ≠1) are equal to `[]`.
