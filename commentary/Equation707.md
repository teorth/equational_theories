This law implies that left multiplications are surjective and right multiplications are injective.

In finite magmas, or in left quasigroups (bijective left multiplications), this law is equivalent to its dual law 2940, and to [law 1316](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1316) and its dual law 2331.  Without such assumptions, law 1316 is equivalent to 2331 and they imply the other two laws, but there are no other implications between these laws.
