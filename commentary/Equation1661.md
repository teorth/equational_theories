## A law with an interesting infinite model

As [discussed in this thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1661.20-.3E.201657.20-.20another.20one.20bites.20the.20dust), this law has an interesting infinite model on the natural numbers that can be used to generate a number of non-trivial anti-implications.
