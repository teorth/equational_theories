## An "Asterix"-like equation

A variant of the ["Asterix" equation, 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65), which [also admits nontrivial infinite models that can be used to produce anti-implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1076.20!.3D.3E.203/near/476293108).

This law and [law 125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125) and [law 229](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?229) are equivalent for finite magmas, or when left multiplications are bijective.  Without such assumptions, law 125 implies law 73 and 229, but no other implication holds.
