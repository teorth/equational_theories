## An "Asterix"-like equation

A variant of the ["Asterix" equation, 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65), which [also admits nontrivial infinite models that can be used to produce anti-implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1076.20!.3D.3E.203/near/476293108).

Law 73 implies that left multiplications are surjective and right multiplications are injective.  Law 73 together with either finiteness, or injectivity of left multiplications, or surjectivity of right multiplications, implies that the magma satisfies [law 125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125) hence is a quasigroup.

For finite magmas, or for quasigroups, laws 73, 125, and [229](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?229) are equivalent.  Without such assumptions, law 125 implies law 73 and 229, but no other implication holds.
