This law, together with [Jordan's second law 906021](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?906021), defines a noncommutative Jordan algebra (with conventions dual to those of http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10825).  See code 17A15 in the Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC 2020).

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
