This law implies [law 310](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?310) `x◇(y◇y) = x◇x` which states that the set of squares forms a submagma (in fact, a left ideal) satisfying the [left unar law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38) `s◇t = s◇s`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
