## "Littlewood"

Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1).  Littlewood is implied by "Ramanujan" [1729](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1729), but it is open whether it is implied by "Hardy" [917](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2541); it does not imply either of these two laws.  However, for finite models, all three laws are equivalent.
