## A twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law

A magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) that is unipotent (all squares are equal to the same element `e`) has a right-unit `e` (`x◇e=x`), is such that the cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x = e◇x` is an involutive automorphism (`C(C(x))=x` and `C(x◇y)=C(x)◇C(y)`), and with the left crossed inverse property, [law 4588](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4588), `(y◇x)◇y = C(x)`.  More symmetrically, for any three elements `x,y,z` of the magma, the equations `x◇y=z`, `y◇C(z)=x`, `z◇x=C(y)` are equivalent.

In short, this law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)` by an involutive automorphism.
