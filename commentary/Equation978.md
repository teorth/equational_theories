## A (crossed) inverse property quasigroup law

This law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `y◇(x◇y) = x` by an involutive automorphism `f`.  The law implies that the magma is a quasigroup, that all squares are equal to a right-unit `e`, that the map `f(x) = e◇x` is an involutive automorphism (`f(f(x))=x` and `f(x◇y)=f(x)◇f(y)`), and that the following inverse properties hold:
- right inverse property `(x◇y)◇f(y) = x`,
- left crossed inverse property `(y◇x)◇y = f(x)`.
