## A weak central groupoid law

A challenging equation.  Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1485).  It is implied by the central groupoid law ([Equation 168](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?168)), but has several unresolved implications to various consequences of that law. It is also equivalent to its dual.

Appears to be resistant to the linear magma method and the "pure" greedy algorithm method, as well as translation-invariant constructions.  However, one can use greedy extensions of "relaxed weak central groupoids" to rule out at least some implications.

Non-trivial finite examples exist, but so far all known examples have an order that is either a square, or twice a square.

Has an intriguing graph-theoretic interpretation in terms of directed graphs with some "good" paths of length two, and an interesting axiom involving 5-cycles in the graph.
