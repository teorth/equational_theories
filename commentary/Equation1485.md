## A weak central groupoid law

A challenging equation, with many unresolved implications.  Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1485).  It is implied by the central groupoid law ([Equation 168](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65)), but has many unresolved implications to various consequences of that law. It is also equivalent to its dual.

Appears to be resistant to the linear magma method and the greedy algorithm method.

Has an intriguing graph-theoretic interpretation in terms of directed graphs with some "good" paths of length two, and an interesting axiom involving 5-cycles in the graph.
