## A weak central groupoid law

A challenging equation.  Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1485).  It is implied by the central groupoid law ([Equation 168](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?168)). It is also equivalent to its dual.

Appears to be resistant to the linear magma method and the "pure" greedy algorithm method, as well as translation-invariant constructions.  However, one can use greedy extensions of "relaxed weak central groupoids" to rule out at least some implications.

Has an intriguing graph-theoretic interpretation in terms of directed graphs with some "good" paths of length two, and an interesting axiom involving 5-cycles in the graph.

The last-standing implications for this equation were resolved with a 32-element magma (that violates equations 151, 3456, 3862) that was later understood using the twisting semigroup method.

Non-trivial finite examples exist, but so far all known examples have an order that is either a square, or twice a square.
For all known examples and all elements x, the non-empty preimages of left-multiplication by x all have the same cardinal (and likewise for right-multiplication).
