See [this chapter of the blueprint](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/906-chapter.html).

The implication to [Equation 3862](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?862) is false for infinite magmas by a greedy construction, but true for finite magmas by a [periodicity argument](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/906-chapter.html).

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.

In a quasigroup this law implies [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x = x◇(x◇x)` and implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.
