The implication to [Equation 3862](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?862) is false for infinite magmas by a greedy construction, but true for finite magmas by a [periodicity argument](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/906-chapter.html).

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.
