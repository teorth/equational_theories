This law states that every left multiplication squares to the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`.  It implies that left multiplications commute with squaring, namely `x◇(y◇y) = (x◇y)◇(x◇y)`, and in particular squares form a submagma satisfying the [involutive left-multiplication law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) and [idempotence law](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3).
