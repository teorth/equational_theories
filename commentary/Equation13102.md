This law is a candidate Austin law: it has infinite models but no finite model have been found.

The equation has an infinite [piecewise linear model](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Some.20results.20from.20order.205/near/554572972) that is surjunctive, namely for any map, from a power of the magma to itself, defined using the magma operation, if the map is injective then it is surjective.

In the class of surjunctive magmas, this law is equivalent to twisted versions of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)` and the [Dupont law 63](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?63) `x = y◇(x◇(x◇y))`, specifically:
- `y◇(x◇y) = B(x)`;
- `y◇(x◇(x◇y)) = Q(x)`;
- `B` and `Q` are magma automorphisms that are inverses of each other.
