This law is equivalent to [law 4501](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4501), which states that products `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` and `(y ◇ z) ◇ x` are equal and only depend on `x`.

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`  `S(S(x)) = ∞` and hence `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
