Another weaker version of the central groupoid law ([Equation 168](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?168)), with a complete rewriting system similar to that equation (as noted for the [dual equation](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2186)).  It has a [graph-theoretic interpretation](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/484345673) and some sporadic finite models of order 11 or 21, though many finite models are of size equal to a square or twice a square.  Many finite implications of this law were falsified through large finite models, as well as via the twisting semigroup method.
