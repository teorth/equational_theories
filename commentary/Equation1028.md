This law is a twist of [law 101](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?101) by the squaring map.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same element `e`, which satisfies `x = x ◇ ((x◇e)◇x)`
