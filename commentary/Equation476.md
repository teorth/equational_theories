## A mysterious "twinned" equation.

This equation is "twinned" with [Equation 503](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?503), in that it seems to imply, and be implied by, exactly the same set of equations, without being equivalent.  There was [no explanation for this phenomenon](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Numerical.20coincidence.3A.20476.20~.20503), but [one has now been proposed](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/483169215).  See also [this further discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Twin.20pairs.20of.20equations).

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.
