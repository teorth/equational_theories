This law implies that all left multiplications are bijective and that the squaring map is involutive.  Such a magma is characterized by

- a choice of involutive squaring map `S:M→M`,

- for each fixed point `x` of `S`, an involution (left multiplication by `x`),

- for each two cycle `x≠S(x)`, a bijection (left multiplication by `x`) whose inverse gives left multiplication by `S(x)`.
