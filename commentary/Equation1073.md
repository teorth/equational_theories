## A twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law

A magma that satisfies this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) that satisfies the right crossed inverse property [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273) (`y◇(x◇y)` is independent of `y`) and such that the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is an involutive automorphism (`B(B(x))=x` and `B(x◇y)=B(x)◇B(y)`).  For any three elements of the magma, the equations `x◇y=z`, `y◇z=B(x)`, and `B(z)◇x=y` are equivalent.

In short, this law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)` by an involutive automorphism.  Analogous twists of law 14 include [law 66](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?66), [law 692](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?692), [law 695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?695), [law 880](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?880), [law 978](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?978), [law 1073](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1073), [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1492), [law 1496](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1496), [law 1695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1695), [law 1719](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1719).

Its dual, law 2494 `x = (y◇((x◇x)◇x))◇y`, has the peculiarity that its lowest-numbered equivalent, law 1152 `x = y◇((z◇(x◇y))◇z)`, has more variables.  There are only four such pairs among laws of order at most 4, namely (1152, 2494), (3349, 3356), (4530, 4549), and (4538, 4545).
