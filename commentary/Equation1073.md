## A (finite) right crossed inverse quasigroup law

This is a very weak form of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `y◇(x◇y) = x`.

In finite magmas, this law implies that the magma is a quasigroup, that the cube map `f(x) = x◇(x◇x)` is an involutive automorphism (`f(f(x))=x` and `f(x◇y)=f(x)◇f(y)`), and that the right crossed inverse property `y◇(x◇y)=f(x)` holds.
