## A twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law

A magma that satisfies this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) that obeys the right crossed inverse property (`y◇(x◇y)` is independent of `y`) and such that the cubing map `C: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is an involutive automorphism (`C(C(x))=x` and `C(x◇y)=C(x)◇y`).  For any three elements of the magma, the equations `x◇y=z`, `y◇z=C(x)`, and `C(z)◇x=y` are equivalent.

In short, this law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)` by an involutive automorphism.
