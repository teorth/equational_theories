This law, in conjunction with [law 26](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?26) `x = (x◇y)◇y` and the idempotence [law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x`, characterizes [the class of 2-perfect 5-cycle systems](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01190966).

In a quasigroup, this law implies a maximal violation of commutativity, in the sense that `x◇y = y◇x` only holds for `x = y`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

This law states that the operation `x◆y = x◇(y◇x)` is commutative.
