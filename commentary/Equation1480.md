This law is a weaker form of the [central groupoid law 168](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?168).

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [conjecturally `{1}∪[4,+∞)`](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative or associative magma or quasigroup.
