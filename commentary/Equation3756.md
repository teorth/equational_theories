This law implies that all squares are equal to an element `e` that is a left unit inside the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` and that right multiplication by `e` is an involution of `P`.

In a quasigroup, the same characterization holds, but the set `P` is the whole magma, so that `x◇y = (y◇x)◇e` for all `x,y∈M`.  Note that `(x◇e)◇e = x`.  This is equivalent to the dual of [law 3714](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3714).
