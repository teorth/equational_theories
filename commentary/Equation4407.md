This law is equivalent to stating that all products of the form `(_ ◇ _) ◇ _` and all those of the form `x ◇ (x ◇ _)` are equal to the same element `e`, which is a left and right zero `e◇x = x◇e = e`.

This law implies that the set of squares is a submagma and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(x)) = e` hence `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of an element `∞` together with the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ` whose consecutive elements must be distinct, with the product `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]` for `s≠t` and all other products equal to `∞`.
