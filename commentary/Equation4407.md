This law is equivalent to [law 4431](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4431), which states that all products of the form `(_ ◇ _) ◇ _` and all those of the form `x ◇ (x ◇ _)` are equal.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of an element `∞` together with the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S` whose consecutive elements must be distinct, with the product `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]` for `s≠t` and all other products equal to `∞`.
