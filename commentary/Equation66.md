## The law for Mendelsohn quasigroups equipped with an involutive automorphism

A magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective).  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is an involutive automorphism (`S(S(x))=x` and `S(x◇y)=S(x)◇S(y)`), and for any three elements `x,y,z` of the magma the equations `x=S(y◇z)`, `y=S(z◇x)`, `z=S(x◇y)` are equivalent.

The operation `x◆y = S(x◇y)` obeys the [Mendelsohn quasigroup law 4961](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4961), namely the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) together with the idempotence [law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3), and the map `S` is an involutive automorphism for `◆`.  Magmas satisfying law 66 are in one-to-one correspondence with Mendelsohn quasigroups equipped with such an involutive automorphism: the operation `◇` is reconstructed by `x◇y = S(x◆y)`.

This law together with associativity is equivalent to stating that the magma is a commutative group of exponent 3.

In short, this law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)` by an involutive automorphism.  Analogous twists of law 14 include [law 66](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?66), [law 692](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?692), [law 695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?695), [law 880](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?880), [law 978](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?978), [law 1073](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1073), [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1492), [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1496), [law 1695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1695), [law 1719](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1719).

This law holds if and only if the left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys [law 53](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?53) `x = x:(y:(x:y))`. so these two laws are parastrophically equivalent in left quasigroups.  This law also implies that the right division operation defined by `(x / y) ◇ y = x` obeys [law 2494](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2494) `x = (y / ((x/x)/x)) / y`, but this is not an equivalence.
