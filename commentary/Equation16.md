## The involutive left-multiplication law

This law, also called [Sade left keys law](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0991), states that left multiplication by any given element is involutive.  In other words, left division exists and coincides with left multiplication.

As noted by [Stein in 1957](https://doi.org/10.1090/S0002-9947-1957-0094404-6), a quasigroup satisfies this law if and only if the right division operation defined by `(x/y)◇y=x` satisfies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43), so law 16 and 43 are parastrophically equivalent.

This law together with the left self-distributive [law 56085](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56085) characterizes involutory racks.  If in addition, the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) holds, the magma is a kei, namely an involutory quandle.

- Law 16 and commutativity ⇔ totally-symmetric quasigroup [law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492).
- Law 16 and existence of a right unit ⇔ [law 508](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?508).
- Among groups, law 16 is equivalent to stating that the group is a Boolean group (abelian group of exponent 2).

On a set with n elements, the number of binary operations satisfying this law is the n-th power of the number of involutions given by [OEIS sequence A000085](https://oeis.org/A000085).
