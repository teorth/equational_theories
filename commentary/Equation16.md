## The involutive left-multiplication law

This law states that left multiplication by any given element is involutive.  In other words, left division exists and coincides with left multiplication.

This law together with the left self-distributive [law 56085](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56085) characterizes involutory racks.  If in addition, the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) holds, the magma is a kei, namely an involutory quandle.
