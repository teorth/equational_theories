## The involutive left-multiplication law

This law, also called [Sade left keys law](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0991), states that left multiplication by any given element is involutive.  In other words, left division exists and coincides with left multiplication.

This law together with the left self-distributive [law 56085](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56085) characterizes involutory racks.  If in addition, the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) holds, the magma is a kei, namely an involutory quandle.

On a set with n elements, the number of binary operations satisfying this law is the n-th power of the number of involutions given by [OEIS sequence A000085](https://oeis.org/A000085).
