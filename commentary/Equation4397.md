This law states that left and right cubes are equal ([law 4380](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4380)), that left multiplications square to constant maps ([law 4268](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4268)) and that left multiplications by squares are constant maps ([law 4583](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4583)).

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
