This law implies [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) `x = x◇(y◇x)`.  Squares are right-units ([law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) `x = x◇(y◇y)` and left zeros ([law 360](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?360) `x◇x = (x◇x)◇y`).

In terms of the undirected graph implied by law 10, which connects `x` and `y` if `x=x◇y` (equivalently `y=y◇x`), this means that squares are connected to all vertices including themselves.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.

The free magma with one generator `x` for this law is a two-element magma `{x,x◇x}`.
