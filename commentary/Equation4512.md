## The associative law

The [associative law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property) is one of the most famous laws in all of algebra.

A magma satisfying this law is called a semigroup.

A quasigroup satisfying this law is called a group.  Among quasigroups, this law is parastrophically equivalent to the [half-group law 3737](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3737): a quasigroup  this law if and only if the operation `x/y` defined by `(x/y)◇y = x` satisfies `x/y = (x/z) / (y/z)`.

A law is implied by the associative law if and only if the left and right hand sides agree after all parentheses have been deleted.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law is the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ`, with the concatenation operation.
