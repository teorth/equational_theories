## The associative law

The [associative law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property) is one of the most famous laws in all of algebra.

A magma satisfying this law is called a semigroup.

A law is implied by the associative law if and only if the left and right hand sides agree after all parentheses have been deleted.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S`, with the concatenation operation.
