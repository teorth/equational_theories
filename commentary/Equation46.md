## The constant law

A very strong law, that makes the entire multiplication table constant.  It is equivalent to [Equation 41](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?41)).  The equivalence class of this law is the second-largest one (419 laws in our list of 4694 laws).

A non-trivial law is implied by the constant law if and only if both sides of the law involve at least one application of the magma operation.  For instance, the commutative and associative laws are implied.

A magma subject to this law is equivalent to a pointed set.
