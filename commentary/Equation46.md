## The constant law

A very strong law, that makes the entire multiplication table constant.  It is equivalent to [Equation 41](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?41)), as well as 417 other laws.

A non-trivial law is implied by the constant law if and only if both sides of the law involve at least one application of the magma operation.
