In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, this law is equivalent to its dual [law 2947](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2947) and to [law 1695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1695), a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).  Without such assumptions, law 1695 implies law 680 and 2947 but no other implication holds.

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.
