## A weak middle crossed inverse quasigroup law

In the finite setting this law is equivalent to [law 1496](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1496), which implies that the magma is a unipotent quasigroup with the middle crossed inverse property.  In general it is weaker.

This law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `y◇(x◇y) = x` by a map `C(x) = x*(x*x)`.  In fact it is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal and that the middle crossed inverse property `y◇(x◇C(y))=x` holds for this function `C`.  (See the [commentary on law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273) for this terminology.)  Contrarily to law 1496, this law does not imply that `C` is an automorphism.

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.
