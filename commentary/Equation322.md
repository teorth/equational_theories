## Dual of a law from MathOverflow

[This response by pastebee](https://mathoverflow.net/a/450905/766) to a [MathOverflow question](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/450890/is-there-an-identity-between-the-commutative-identity-and-the-constant-identity) established that the dual of this law (namely [law 387](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?387)) was strictly between the [constant law 46](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?46) and the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).
