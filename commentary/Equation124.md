## A mysterious "twinned" equation.

This equation is "twinned" with [Equation 1119](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1119), in that it seems to imply, and be implied by, exactly the same set of equations, without being equivalent.  There is currently [no complete explanation for this phenomenon](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Numerical.20coincidence.3A.20476.20~.20503), though [some hints of an explanation have emerged through analysis of linear models](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Twin.20pairs.20of.20equations).

It implies [Equation 1924](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1924) for finite magmas.  Dually, the law 206 discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1648.20!.3D.3E.20206) implies [Equation 1648](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1648) for finite magmas. For infinite magmas, the implication is false, with [one construction based on the infinite 3-regular tree](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1648.20!.3D.3E.20206/near/476985846).

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.
