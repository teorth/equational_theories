## A directoid law

A directoid is a magma satisfying this law, [law 333](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?333), its dual 377, and the idempotence [law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3).  The binary relation `x ≤ y` defined by `x◇y=x` or equivalently `y◇x=x` is a partial order, and one has `x◇y ≤ x` and `x◇y ≤ y`.
