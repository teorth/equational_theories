This law states that left multiplications all square to the same map `B: y ↦ y◇(y◇y)`, and right multiplication by a square is a constant map.  In particular `B(y) = S(S(y))` for `S: y ↦ y◇y` the squaring map.

The set of squares `im(S)` is a submagma.  The set of left cubes `im(B) = im(S ∘ S)` is a submagma.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
