This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(S(x))) = S(x)`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a quasigroup this law implies the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x`.  In a quasigroup, this law holds if and only if the left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y)=y` satisfies [law 124](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?124) `x = y:((y:x):x)`, if and only if the right division operation defined by `(x/y)◇y=x` satisfies [law 335](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?335) `x/y = y/(y/x)`, namely the laws 124, 335, 3343 (and their duals 206, 384, 4130) are parastrophically equivalent.
