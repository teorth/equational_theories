For finite models, magmas must be left-cancellative and squaring must be a bijection; this leads to a way to "reflect" magmas obeying this law to obtain a "mirror image" magma that also obeys the law.  See [this discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/484117783).

Some implications from equation 1518 were refuted using a [huge finite magma with 232 elements](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/486217486) which was barely verifiable using Lean.  See the end of [a list of useful magmas](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Generated/All4x4Tables/data/plan.txt) for its operation table.
