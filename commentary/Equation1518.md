For finite models, magmas must be left-cancellative and squaring must be a bijection; this leads to a way to "reflect" magmas obeying this law to obtain a "mirror image" magma that also obeys the law.  See [this discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/484117783).

For finite magmas, the unproven consequents of this law are essentially asserting that every element of the magma generates a submagma of order 1 or 3.
