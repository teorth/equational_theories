This law states that products of the form `x◇((y◇y)◇x)` are right units.  It implies [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) (squares are right units).

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that the quasigroup is a unipotent loop, namely all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same two-sided unit element.  The left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` then satisfies the same law.
