This law is equivalent to law 3738, `x◇y = (x◇z) ◇ (y◇w)` which states that the magma operation is constant on right cosets.  It is equivalent to [law 385](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?385) `x◇y = (x◇z)◇y` together with the [reduction law 327](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?327) `x◇y = x◇(y◇z)`.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is `S × ({0} ⊔ S)` with the operation `(s,_)◇(t,_)=(s,t)`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
