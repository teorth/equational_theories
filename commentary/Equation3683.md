This law implies the [unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40), namely all squares are equal to the same element `e`.  Additionally, all products of the form `(_◇_)◇(_◇_)` are equal to `e`, namely the submagma `P={x◇y|x,y∈M}` is equipped with the constant law.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
