Law 2744 (dual of law 883) implies that left multiplications are injective and right multiplications are surjective.

For finite magmas, or for quasigroups, [law 1323](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1323), [law 1526](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1526), and [law 2744](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2744) are equivalent.  Without these assumptions, law 1323 implies law 1526 but no other implication holds.

The non-implication from law 1323 to law 2744 was among the last ones to be obtained, through [a hybrid model](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/1323-chapter.html).

The laws 1323, 1526, 2744 are twists of laws [125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125), [73](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?73), [229](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?229) by the squaring map.

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [unknown](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
