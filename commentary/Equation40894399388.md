## The orthomodular lattice Sheffer stroke law

It was shown by [McCune, Padmanabhan, Rose, Veroff](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00012-004-1902-0) that a magma operation satisfies this law if and only if it is the Sheffer stroke of an [orthomodular lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complemented_lattice#Orthomodular_lattices).

This is an order 10 law with four variables.  It is not known whether there exist equivalent laws of lower order or number of variables.
