This law states that products of the form `x◇((x◇_)◇x)` are right units.  It implies that left cubes `x◇(x◇x)` are right units ([law 56](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56)) and particular fourth powers `x◇((x◇x)◇x)` as well ([law 643](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?643)).

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or (quasi)group.
