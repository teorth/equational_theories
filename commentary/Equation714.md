A magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) in which right division is the cube of left multiplication.

This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 511](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?511) and [law 2338](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2388).  In finite magmas, or when left multiplications are assumed to be bijective, these three laws are equivalent.

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` (or equivalently `x : y = x ◇ ((x ◇ y) ◇ x)`) satisfies [law 464](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?464).  Conversely, in a magma satisfying law 464, if left multiplications are bijective (which is automatic if the magma is finite) then left division satisfies law 714.  Thus, laws 714 and 474 are parastrophically equivalent for (left-)quasigroups.  They share the same finite spectrum.

This law is part of a series of laws that state that the magma is a quasigroup in which right division is some k-th power of left multiplication: the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) for `k=1`, [law 125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125) for `k=2`, this law for `k=3`, law 5974 for `k=4`, and so on.  For each `k>1`, there exist two weaker laws that are equivalent to it in the finite case or when left multiplications are assumed to be bijective.
