## A law for sets equipped with a self-map

This law states that the magma operation is right-projection composed with squaring, namely `x◇y = f(y)` where `f: y ↦ y◇y`.  Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with sets equipped with a self-map.

See the dual [law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38) for further comments.
