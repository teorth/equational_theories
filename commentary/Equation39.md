## A law for sets equipped with a self-map

This law states that the magma operation is right-projection composed with squaring, namely `x◇y = f(y)` where `f: y ↦ y◇y`.  Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with sets equipped with a self-map.

Any law that implies this law (laws 5, 13, 41, 62, 336, 463, 3349, …) describes sets equipped with a self-map subject to a condition.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is `ℕ×S` with `f(m,s)=(m+1,s)`, namely `(m,s) ◇ (n,t) = (m+1,s)`.
