This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a quasigroup, this law holds if and only if the left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 222](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?222) `x = (y:(x:y)):y`, and if and only if the right division operation defined by `(x/y)◇y = x` satisfies the [Dupont law 63](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?63) `x = y/(x/(x/y))`.  Thus, laws 3548, 222, 63, and their duals 3954, 125, 271 are parastrophically equivalent.
