## An involutive crossed inverse quasigroup law

This law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `y◇(x◇y) = x` by an involutive automorphism `f`.  Specifically, the middle crossed inverse property `f(y)◇(x◇y)=x` holds, or equivalently `(f(y)◇x)◇y=x`, for some map `f` with `f(f(x)) = x` and `f(x◇y) = f(x)◇f(y)`.

It implies that all squares are equal to the same element `e`, which is central, and `f(x) = x ◇ e = e ◇ x`.

A different twist is [law 692](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?692), in which `f` is not assumed to be involutive, but one imposes additionally that `y◇(x◇y)` and `(y◇x)◇y` are independent of `y`.
