## The 1978 Putnam "bypass law"

Called the "bypass law" in the 1978 Putnam, which also introduced [Equation 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?381) and [Equation 3722](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3722). Problem A4 of the 1978 Putnam asked to show (in our language) that [Equation 3744 implies Equations 3722 and 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#3744_implies_3722_381). 

This law is equivalent to the [associative law 4512](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4512) together with the [law 381](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?381) `x◇y = (x◇z)◇y`.  It implies exactly the laws whose left-hand side and right-hand side have the same first variable and the same last variable and the operation appears at least once on each side.  (In that respect it is analogous to [law 3634](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3634).)

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is `S ⊔ S×S`, with the magma operation `s◇t=(s,t)`, `s◇(t,u)=(s,u)`, `(s,t)◇u=(s,u)`, `(s,t)◇(u,v)=(s,v)`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
