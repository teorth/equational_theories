In left quasigroups (magmas with bijective left divisions), the left division operation defined by `xâ—‡(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 879](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?879), `x = y:((x:y):(x:x))` and the converse holds in left quasigroups; thus the two laws are parastrophically equivalent for left quasigroups.
