## An Asterix-like equation

Discussed in [this thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1076.20!.3D.3E.203) and [this thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1648.20!.3D.3E.20206).

A nice example of a translation-invariant magma obeying this equation is `x â—‡ y = x - sgn(y-x)` on the integers.

The coefficients of the linearization `ax+by` of 1648 are the golden ratio.
