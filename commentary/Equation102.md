This law implies that the magma operation is idempotent.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a left quasigroup, this law is equivalent to idempotence together with the involutive right-multiplication [law 26](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?26), and it is equivalent to the statement that the left division operation defined by `xâ—‡(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 332](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?332) `x:y = y:(x:x)`, thus these laws are parastrophically equivalent.
