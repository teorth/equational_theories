This law implies that left and right multiplications are surjective, that the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is surjective and the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is injective, with `B(C(x)) = x`.

The operations defined by `x : y = C(y) ◇ x` and `x / y = C(y) ◇ C(x)` satisfy `y ◇ (y : x) = x` and `(x / y) ◇ y = x`, hence they can serve as (not necessarily unique) left and right divisions.  In addition, `(y / x) : y = x`.

This is a (rather weak) twisted version of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).  In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, it is equivalent to stating that the left and right cubing maps are bijective and inverses of each other, and that the right crossed inverse property ([law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273)) holds.
