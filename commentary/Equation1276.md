This law implies that left and right multiplications are surjective, that one cubing map `B: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is injective and the other cubing map `C: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is surjective, with `C(B(x)) = x`.

The operations defined by `x : y = B(y) ◇ x` and `x / y = B(y) ◇ B(x)` obey `y ◇ (y : x) = x` and `(x / y) ◇ y = x`, hence they can serve as (not necessarily unique) left and right divisions.  In addition, `(y / x) : y = x`.

This is a (rather weak) twisted version of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).  In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, it implies the right crossed inverse property, [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273).
