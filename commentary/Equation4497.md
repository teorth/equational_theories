This law states that products `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` and `(y ◇ y) ◇ x` are equal and only depend on `x`.

This law implies that the set of squares is a submagma.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(x)) = S(S(y))` and thus `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same central element.
