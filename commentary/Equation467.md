This law is a twist of the [Dupont law 63](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?63) by the squaring map.  It implies that left multiplications are surjective.

Finite magmas satisfying this law are left quasigroups (left multiplications are bijective), the squaring and cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` are inverse bijections, and [law 2847](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2847) holds.  In addition, the operation defined by `x◆y = x◇(x◇y)` satisfies [law 1722](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1722) `x=(y◆y)◆((x◆y)◆y)`.  The left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` obeys [law 437](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?437), `x = x:(y:(y:(x:y)))` and the converse holds assuming that `y↦x:y` are bijective maps; thus the two laws are parastrophically equivalent for left quasigroups.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial semigroup (associative magma).

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [unknown](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
