This law is a twist of [law 329](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?329) by the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`, and is equivalent to it if `S` is surjective.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same left unit element `e`, namely `e◇x = x`.
