## The Mendelsohn quasigroup law

This law is equivalent to the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) together with the idempotence [law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3).

Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with [Mendelsohn directed triple systems](https://ajc.maths.uq.edu.au/pdf/71/ajc_v71_p485.pdf), with the operation defined by `x ◇ x = x` and `x ◇ y = z` (and cyclic permutations thereof) whenever `x,y,z` form a triple.  There is a different one-to-one correspondence with magmas satisfying the semi-symmetric loop [law 887](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?887), obtained by making all squares equal to a new two-sided unit element.

Magmas that satisfy this law together with the commutative [law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) are called squags (Steiner quasigroups) and are characterized by [law 4964](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4964).

The lowest-numbered laws characterizing Mendelsohn quasigroups are 4961, 4999, but there are numerous others of that order.
