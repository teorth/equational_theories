This law states that all cubes are equal to the same element `∞` and that all products of the form `(x ◇ x) ◇ y` are also equal to the same element `∞`.

The magma operation is characterized by `∞`, the set `Q` of squares (which contains `∞`), the suitably surjective squaring map `S`, and the remaining entries `x ◇ y ∈ M` for `x ∈ M∖Q`, `y ∈ M ∖ {x, S(x)}`.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
