This equation admits a simple but non-trivial model on the integers `a â—‡ b = 2 * a - b / 2` which can be [used to disprove an implication](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/695).  Was [first discovered](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1/near/477929143) by exploring non-commutative linear models.
