This law states that `L_y ∘ R_z` is involutive for all `y,z`, where `L_z(x) = z◇x` and `R_z(x) = x◇z` are left/right multiplications.

Commutative magmas obeying this law are the same as magmas obeying [law 556](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?556).

This equation admits a simple but non-trivial model on the integers `a ◇ b = 2 * a - b / 2` (with truncated division) which can be [used to disprove an implication](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/695).  Was [first discovered](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1/near/477929143) by exploring non-commutative linear models.
