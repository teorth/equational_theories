This law states that `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` and `(y ◇ y) ◇ x` are all equal to the same element `∞` which is a left and right zero (`∞◇x = x◇∞ = ∞`).

It implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(x)) = ∞` and hence `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
