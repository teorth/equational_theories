The free magma with one generator for this law is a two-element magma isomorphic to `ℤ/2ℤ` equipped with `x◇y=x+1`.  In other words, in any magma satisfying this law one has the [trivial right cubing law 23](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?23) `(x◇x)◇x = x`, the [involutive squaring law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151) `(x◇x)◇(x◇x)=x`, and [law 307](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?307) `(x◇x)◇x = x◇x`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
