This law is equivalent to stating the [unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40) (all squares are equal to the same idempotent element `e`) and the relation `x ◇ (e ◇ x) = e`.

In a quasigroup the law is equivalent to the [left-unit squares law 31](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?31), namely to `x◇x=e` and `e◇x=x`.
