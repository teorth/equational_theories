## A law for groups of exponent 4

It was shown by Kunen (The shortest single axioms for groups of exponent 4. *Computers and Mathematics with Applications,* 29:1-12, 1995) that this law characterizes groups of exponent 4.

See law 1571 for groups of exponent 2 (which are automatically abelian) and law 163669 for groups of exponent 3.
