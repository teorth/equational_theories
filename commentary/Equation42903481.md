## A law for groups of exponent 4

It was shown by [Kunen](https://doi.org/10.1016/0898-1221(94)00212-4) that this law characterizes groups of exponent 4 (not necessarily abelian).

See law 1571 for groups of exponent 2 (which are automatically abelian) and law 163669 for groups of exponent 3 and further comments.
