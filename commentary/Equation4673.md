## The non-associative-permutative law

This is described by the NAP operad, which has a nice closed description using the species of rooted trees. Equivalently, the free NAP algebras can be described using rooted trees.

Equivalently, this law states that right multiplications commute.  It is also called the left-normal law, or right-permutability, or right-commutativity.  It is one of the conditions defining [Novikov algebras](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02238).
