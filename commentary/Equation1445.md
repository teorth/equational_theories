This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a quasigroup this law implies that all left cubes are equal to the same element `x◇(x◇x) = e` which is idempotent (`e◇e = e`).  In addition, the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and the map `x ↦ x◇e` are bijections, inverses of each other.  Finite quasigroups of low order satisfy the left crossed-inverse property `(y◇x)◇y = (x◇x)◇x` (dual to [law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273)).
