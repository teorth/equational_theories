This law is part of a [longest chain of implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Longest.20implication.20chain/near/521750611) 2 → … → 3715 → 326 → 307 → 3253 → 1 between inequivalent laws of order up to 4.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) group.  In a left quasigroup it is equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3).
