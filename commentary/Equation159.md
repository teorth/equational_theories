This law is [Schröder's second law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12844), as named by Sade [1].

In a magma satisfying this law, squaring is an involution (and in particular is bijective), and the operation fails the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) maximally, in the sense that `x◇y = y◇x` only holds for `x = y`.

Among quasigroups, this law is equivalent to all of its parastrophes, in the sense that it holds for `◇` if and only if it holds for the left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` or the right division operation defined by `(x/y)◇y=x`, or the same operations with their operands swapped.

Among semigroups (associative magmas) this law is equivalent to [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) characterizing [rectangular bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_(algebra)).  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
