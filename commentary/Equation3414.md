This law states that left multiplication maps restricted to the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` are involutions.  It implies that `P` obeys [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `p = q◇(q◇p)` for `p,q∈P`.  In particular, the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` restricted to `P` is the identity map.

In a quasigroup, `P` coincides with `M`, so that this law is simply equivalent to the involutive left multiplications law 16.
