## A law related to Boolean subgroups of the bijections

This law implies that left multiplications are bijective and commute.  The cubing maps `B: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` and `C: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` are bijections of order 3 and inverses of each other (`x = B(C(x)) = B(B(B(x)))`), and they commute with left multiplications (`B(x◇y) = x◇B(y)`).  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is an endomorphism such that `S(S(S(S(x)))) = S(x)`.

The map `φ: (M,◇) → (Bij(M),∘)` from `M` to the group of bijections of `M` (equipped with composition), defined by setting `φ(x)` to be the bijection `y ↦ x ◇ C(y)`, is a magma morphism, namely, `x ◇ C(y ◇ C(z)) = (x ◇ y) ◇ C(z)`.  The image `H = φ(M)` consists of involutions, it is an abelian subgroup `H ⊂ Bij(M)` of exponent 2 which commutes with the `ℤ/3ℤ` subgroup `{id,B,C}`.  In particular, `φ` maps all squares to the identity, hence maps an element `x∈M` and `B(x)` and `C(x)` to the same bijection.

The submagma `φ⁻¹(id) = {x, ∀y x◇C(y)=y}` contains all squares, and on this submagma the operation `◇` is right-projection composed with `B`, namely `s◇t = B(t)` for all `s,t ∈ φ⁻¹(id)`.  The fibers `φ⁻¹(h)` for `h∈H` are in (non-canonical) bijection with each other: for any `x ∈ φ⁻¹(h)`, left multiplication by `x` is a bijection of `M` that interchanges `φ⁻¹(h)` and `φ⁻¹(id)`, and squares to `C`.

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies the same law, `x = y : (z : ((y : z) : x))`.  The operation `x ◆ y = x ◇ C(y)` satisfies the same law, with both cubing maps being equal to the identity, namely `x ◆ (x ◆ x) = x` and `(x ◆ x) ◆ x = x`.  Conversely, given an operation `◆` satisfying this law, one can twist by any `B` bijection of order 3 of each fiber to get an operation `x ◇ y = x ◆ B(y)` that satisfies the law.

This law implies the [medial law 934128](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?934128) so quasigroups satisfying this law are linear.  It appears that all magmas satisfying this law are submagmas of linear magmas satisfying it.  Finite magmas of odd sizes that satisfy this law also satisfy [law 62](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?62), namely all left multiplications are equal to the same bijection of order 3.
