The implication to [Equation 4065](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4065) was refuted for infinite magmas [by a greedy argument](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.20879.20!.3D.3E.204065), and for finite magmas by a counterexample of size 12 obtained as a [semi-direct product](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/484838720) of linear models over ℤ/2ℤ and (ℤ/2ℤ)×(ℤ/3ℤ), which marked the start of the "magma cohomology" method.  The implication cannot be refuted by [any smaller magma](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Shrinking.20the.20size-232.20magma.20for.20law.201518.20to.20size.2015/near/554195623), and this magma of size 12 refutes all non-implications from law 879, namely the only laws of order up to 4 that it obeys are law 879 and its consequences.

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.  Finite magmas satisfying this law are left quasigroups (left multiplications are bijective).  The left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 632](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?632), `x = x:(y:((x:y):x))` and the converse holds in left quasigroups; thus the two laws are parastrophically equivalent for left quasigroups.
