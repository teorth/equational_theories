The implication to [Equation 4805](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4805) was refuted for infinite magmas [by a greedy argument](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.20879.20!.3D.3E.204065), and for finite magmas [by a "semi-direct product" construction](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/484838720) that led to an order 12 counterexample.
