The implication to [Equation 4065](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4065) was refuted for infinite magmas [by a greedy argument](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.20879.20!.3D.3E.204065), and for finite magmas [by a "semi-direct product" construction](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/484838720) that led to an order 12 counterexample.

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.  Finite magmas satisfying this law are left quasigroups (left multiplications are bijective).  The left division operation defined by `xâ—‡(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 632](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?632), `x = x:(y:((x:y):x))` and the converse holds in left quasigroups; thus the two laws are parastrophically equivalent for left quasigroups.
