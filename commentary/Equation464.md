This law implies that left and right multiplications are surjective.  The operations defined by `x : y = y ◇ (y ◇ (y ◇ x))` and `x / y = x : (x : (x : y))` obey `y ◇ (y : x) = x` and `(x / y) ◇ y = x`, hence they can serve as (not necessarily unique) left and right divisions.  In addition, `(y / x) : y = x`.

The left division `x : y` defined in this way satisfies [law 2338](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2338) `y = (x : (x : (x : y))) : x`, which for (left-)quasigroups is equivalent to [law 714](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?714).  Thus, for (left-)quasigroups, law 464 is parastrophically equivalent to [law 714](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?714).
