## The inverse loop law

An inverse loop is a loop (quasi-group with a two-sided identity) in which every element `x` has an inverse `x'` such that `x'*(x*y) = y` and `(x*y)*y' = x`.  It was shown by Padmanabhan (Inverse loops as groupoids with one law.  *J. London Math. Soc.,* 2(1 44):203-206, 1969) that this law characterizes division `x◇y = x/y` in an inverse loop, in the sense that the product `x * y := x◇((y◇y)◇y)` obeys the axioms of inverse loops if and only if the law 259258 is obeyed.
