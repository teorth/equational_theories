This law states that the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is an involution (`B(B(x))=x`), and that all left multiplications square to `B` (and in particular are bijective).

In a left quasigroup, this law is satisfied if and only if the left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` (or equivalently `x : y = x ◇ B(y)`) satisfies the same law.
