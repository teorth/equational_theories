This law states that all products of the form `_ ◇ (y ◇ y)` are equal to the same element, say `∞`, which is a right zero (`x ◇ ∞ = ∞`).  This fixes the magma operation on `M × Q` where `Q = {x ◇ x | x ∈ M}` is the set of squares.  The magma law is characterized by `∞ ∈ Q ⊂ M`, the squaring map `M∖Q → Q` whose image must be `Q` or `Q∖{∞}`, and the rest of the magma operation `x ◇ y` for `x ∈ M` and `y ∈ M∖Q` and `x≠y`.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  The set of squares is a submagma.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
