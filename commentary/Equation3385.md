This law implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) and [associative law 4512](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4512).

The submagma `P = {x◇y| x,y∈M}` is an associative sloop, namely it is associative, commutative, obeys the [Putnam law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14), and has a two-sided identity element `e`.  In addition, all squares are equal to the identity element, `x◇x=e` for `x∈M`.

(Cf. the [sloop law 63702](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?63702) and the (weaker) totally-symmetric quasigroup [law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492).)

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is `S ⊔ 𝒫(S)` where `𝒫` is the power set, with the magma operation `s◇t={s}∆{t}`, `A◇s = s◇A = A∆{s}`, `A◇B = A∆B` where `∆` is the symmetric difference.  In particular, `s◇(s◇s) = {s} ≠ s`.
