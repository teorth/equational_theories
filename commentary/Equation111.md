This law implies that squares are right units ([law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11), `x = x◇(y◇y)`), and their right cosets too, namely [law 109](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?109), `x = x◇((y◇y)◇z)`.  It cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).
