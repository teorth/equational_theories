## The natural central groupoid law

It was shown [by Knuth](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#knuth) that [this law characterizes](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#natural-central-groupoid) "natural central groupoids", which, up to isomorphisms, are Cartesian squares `S × S` with magma operation `(a,b) ∘ (c,d) = (b,c)`. These are special cases of central groupoids (Equation 168).

The equivalence class of this law consists, up to order 5, of 30 to 34 laws: 19812, 19814, 19816, 19846, 19849, 19851, 19853, 19882, 19883, 19884, 19888, 19892, 19894, 19895, 19897, and their duals (which include 26302), and possibly 19809, 19887 and their dual.  The latter laws are implied by 26302 but they might allow for magmas that are not natural central groupoids.
