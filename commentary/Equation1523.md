This law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal to the same element `e` ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) and that `e ◇ (x ◇ e) = x`.  The products `x ◇ y` for `x,y≠e` and `x≠y` are unconstrained.  In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, it is equivalent to its dual, [law 2132](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2132).
