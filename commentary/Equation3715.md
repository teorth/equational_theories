This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 326](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?326) `x ◇ y = x ◇ (y ◇ y)` and its dual law 375.

This law is part of all [longest chains of implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Longest.20implication.20chain/near/521750611) such as 2 → 4 → 1037 → 1237 → 103 → 824 → 9 → 418 → 48 → 412 → 3 → 3715 → 326 → 307 → 3253 → 1 between inequivalent laws of order up to 4.  It implies that the squaring map is an involution ([law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151)).

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

The free magma with one generator `x` for this law is a two-element magma `{x,x◇x}` with the constant law.
