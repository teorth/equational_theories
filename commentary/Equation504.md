In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, this law is equivalent to [law 910](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?910) and equivalent to [law 1925](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1925).  Without such assumptions, law 910 implies law 504 and law 1925, but no other implication holds.

This law is a twist of [law 73](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?73) by the squaring map.

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.
