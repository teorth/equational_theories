This law states that squaring commutes with left multiplication (namely `x ◇ (y ◇ y) = (x ◇ y) ◇ (x ◇ y)`), and that left multiplication by a product is a constant map (namely `(x ◇ y) ◇ z` does not depend on `z`).  The magma operation is characterized by the subset `P = {x ◇ y | x,y∈M}`, the squaring map with values in that subset, and left multiplications that commute with it.

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The magma admits at least one left zero element.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
