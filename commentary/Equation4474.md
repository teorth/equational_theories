This law states that squaring commutes with left multiplication (namely `x ◇ (y ◇ y) = (x ◇ y) ◇ (x ◇ y)`), and that left multiplication by a product is a constant map (namely `(x ◇ y) ◇ z` does not depend on `z`).  The magma operation is characterized by the subset `P = {x ◇ y | x,y∈M}`, the squaring map with values in that subset, and left multiplications that commute with it.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
