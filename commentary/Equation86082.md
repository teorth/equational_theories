## The law for modules over the Gaussian integers

As [we discuss here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/The.20.22modules.20over.20Gaussian.20integers.22.20law/with/519928430), this order-6 law characterizes the operation `x ◇ y = x + i y` in modules over the ring `ℤ[i]` of Gaussian integers, where `i` is the square root of -1.

The equivalence class of this law among laws of order 6 has 18 to 25 members: the laws 86082, 86160, 125935, 127386, 127464, 127560, 128214, 184602, 185406, 185442, 186339, 251586, 251959, 252414, 252439, 444561, 446262, 446340 are equivalent; the laws 86046, 86064, 444507, 446226, 446244 are only known to be equivalent in the finite case and their equivalence in the infinite case is unknown; and the remaining candidates are 127759, 183687.
