## The right-invertive law

This law is also confusingly called the left-modular law, or [Grassmann's associative law](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2285).

It implies that the set of squares, the set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`, and the set of right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` are submagmas.

This law implies the [medial law 934128](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?934128) hence quasigroups satisfying this law are linear.  Linear models take the form `x◇y = b²x+by+c`.

Magmas satisfying its dual, [the left-invertive law 4684](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4684), are known as right-modular, or as AG-groupoids (Abel-Grassmann groupoids), and if they additionally satisfy [law 4362](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4362) they are AG∗∗-groupoids.
