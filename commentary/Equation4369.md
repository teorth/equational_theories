## The right-invertive law

This law is also confusingly called the left-modular law, or [Grassmann's associative law](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2285).

Magmas satisfying its dual, [the left-invertive law 4684](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4684), are known as right-modular, or as AG-groupoids (Abel-Grassmann groupoids), and if they additionally satisfy [law 4362](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4362) they are AG∗∗-groupoids.
