This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is an idempotent morphism, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)` and `S(x◇y) = S(x)◇S(y)`.  Its image is thus a submagma.

In a quasigroup this law is equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x` together with the [involutive right multiplications law 26](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?26).  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
