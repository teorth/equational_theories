This weak law holds for instance in any magma that satisfies the [2-reductive law 9](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?9) or the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).

In a left quasigroup (bijective left multiplications), the left division map defined by `xâ—‡(x:y) = y` obeys [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1492), a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law by an automorphism.  These laws are thus parastrophically equivalent in left quasigroups.
