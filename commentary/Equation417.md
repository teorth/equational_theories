This weak law holds for instance in any magma that satisfies the [2-reductive law 9](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?9) or the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).

In a left quasigroup (bijective left multiplications), this law is obeyed if and only if the left division map defined by `xâ—‡(x:y) = y` obeys [law 477](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?477) `x = y:(x:(y:(y:y)))`, itself equivalent for left quasigroups to [law 1492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1492) `x = (y:x) : (y:(y:y))`, a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law by an automorphism.  These laws are thus parastrophically equivalent in left quasigroups.
