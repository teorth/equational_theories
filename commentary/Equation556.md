A magma satisfying this law is a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective) and this law implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).

For commutative magmas, it is equivalent to [law 562](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?562), which states that `L_y ∘ L_z` is involutive for all `y,z`, and to [law 1117](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1117), which states that `L_y ∘ R_z` is involutive for all `y,z`, where `L_z(x) = z◇x` and `R_z(x) = x◇z`.  Without commutativity the laws 562 and 1117 are weaker and are inequivalent to each other.

The equivalence class of this law is large (12 laws in our list of 4694 laws).
