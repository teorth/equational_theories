This law implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).

For commutative magmas, it is equivalent to [law 562](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?562), which states that `L_y ∘ L_z` is involutive for all `y,z`, and to [law 1117](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1117), which states that `L_y ∘ R_z` is involutive for all `y,z`, where `L_z(x) = z◇x` and `R_z(x) = x◇z`.  Without commutativity the laws 562 and 1117 are weaker and are inequivalent to each other.
