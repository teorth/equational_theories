This law implies that all left multiplications are bijective and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is an involution.  The left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` satisfies the same law 138, namely `x = y : ((z : y) : x)`.

Composing two right multiplications gives a constant map, namely `(z◇x)◇y = (w◇x)◇y`, so the magma cannot be a (non-trivial) quasigroup.

The related [law 727](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?727) is a higher-order analogue which was analyzed more thoroughly.
