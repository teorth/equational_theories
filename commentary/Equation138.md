This law implies that all left multiplications are bijective, that the squaring and right-cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` are involutions, and the left-cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` equals `C ∘ S`.  The left division operation defined by `x◇(x:y) = y` satisfies the same law 138, namely `x = y : ((z : y) : x)`.

Composing two right multiplications gives a constant map, namely `(z◇x)◇y = (w◇x)◇y`, so the magma cannot be a (non-trivial) quasigroup.  It cannot either be a non-trivial commutative magma.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [right-projection law 5](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?5).

The related [law 727](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?727) is a higher-order analogue which was analyzed more thoroughly.
