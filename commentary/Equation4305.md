This law implies that left multiplications all square to the same map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)`, and that the [right crossed-inverse law 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273) `y◇(x◇y)=B(x)` holds.

The set of left cubes `im(B)` is a submagma.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together with the fact that left multiplications all square to the same map, namely `y◇(y◇x) = x◇(x◇x)`.
