This has been dubbed the [shift-associative
law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07078) or [nearly-associative
law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00390), or the [cyclic associative law](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2285) (but [law 4364](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4364) has been named the same).

This law implies that the set of cubes `x◇(x◇x) = (x◇x)◇x` is a submagma.

Quasigroups satisfying this law are abelian groups equipped with addition.

This law together with the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) is equivalent to idempotence, commutativity, and associativity.  An idempotent magma satisfying this law is thus precisely a semilattice (poset equipped with a finite join or meet operation).  This law and idempotence form a 2-basis of the equational law of the magma `{0,1}` equipped with `x◇y=min(x,y)`.  The same property holds for idempotent magmas satisfying [law 4364](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4364) `x◇(y◇z) = y◇(z◇x)` or its dual law 4679.
