This has been dubbed the [shift-associative
law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07078) or [nearly-associative
law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00390), or the [cyclic associative law](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2285) (but [law 4364](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4364) has been named the same).

This law implies that the set of cubes `x◇(x◇x) = (x◇x)◇x` is a submagma.

Quasigroups satisfying this law are abelian groups equipped with addition.
