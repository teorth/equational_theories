## Right-projection

This law specifies the magma operation to be the projection on the right operand.  Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with sets with no structure.  Depending on context, they can be called right-zero semigroups, or right-zero bands.

This law implies exactly the laws whose left-hand side and right-hand side have the same last variable, in particular the idempotent and associative laws.  Left multiplication is trivially bijective.

The equivalence class of this law is among the largest ones (71 laws in our list of 4694 laws).  This law or its dual are part of all [longest chains of implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Longest.20implication.20chain/near/521750611) between inequivalent laws of order up to 4.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is `S` itself.
