## Right-projection

This law specifies the magma operation to be the projection on the right operand.  Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with sets with no structure.

This law implies exactly the laws whose left-hand side and right-hand side have the same last variable, in particular the idempotent and associative laws.  Left multiplication is trivially bijective.
