## The right-unit right cubes law

This law states that right cubes are right units (not necessarily equal) and in particular form a submagma (on which the operation reduces to left projection).

The analogues for squares, left cubes and right cubes are [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11), [law 56](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56) and law 108, and for different fourth powers are [law 440](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?440), [law 643](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?643), [law 846](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?846), [law 1049](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1049), and [law 1252](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1252).
