This law is equivalent to [law 4468](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4468) which states that all products `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` and all products of the form `(_ ◇ _) ◇ _` are equal to the same element `∞`.

In particular, this law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
