This law is equivalent to stating that all products `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` and all products of the form `(_ ◇ _) ◇ _` are equal to the same element `∞` that is a left and right zero (`∞◇x = x◇∞ = x`).

This law implies that the set of squares is a submagma and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`  `S(S(x)) = ∞` so `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of an element `∞` together with the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ` whose last and third to last element may not be equal, with the product `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]` except `[s] ◇ [t, s] = ∞`, and all other products equal to `∞`.
