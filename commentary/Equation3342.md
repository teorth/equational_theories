For finite magmas this law implies [law 3522](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3522) and [law 4118](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4118).  Contrarily to proofs of other finite implications, mostly based on the equivalence of injectivity and surjectivity for maps on the finite magma, the [proofs of these finite implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Austin.20pairs/near/482525422) involves an iteration of the left-cube map `x ↦ x◇(x◇x)`.
