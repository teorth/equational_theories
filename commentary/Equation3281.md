This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(x)`.  It also implies that the set of squares `im(S)` is a left ideal (hence a submagma) thanks to `x◇S(y) = S(x◇y)`.  In particular the left cubes are squared squares, `x◇(x◇x) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
