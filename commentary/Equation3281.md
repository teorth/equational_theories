This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(x)`.  It also implies that the set of squares `im(S)` is a left ideal (hence a submagma) thanks to `x◇S(y) = S(x◇y)`.  In particular the left cubes are squared squares, `x◇(x◇x) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In quasigroups (more generally when left multiplications are injective), this law is equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x = x◇x` together with [law 75](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?75) `x = y◇(y◇(y◇x))`.
