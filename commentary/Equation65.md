## Equations [65 `x = y ◇ (x ◇ (y ◇ x))`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65), [1491 `x = (y ◇ x) ◇ (y ◇ (y ◇ x))`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1491): "Asterix and Obelix"
Equation 65 is one of the simplest equations for which several outgoing implications remain unresolved, see [this ongoing discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Equation.2065.20-.3E.20Equation.20359). In particular, it is unknown whether either of these equations implies the other, although 1491 implies all seven equations for which it is unknown whether 65 implies it. One of the issues is that there seems to be a difference of behavior between the finite and infinite models of these equations.
