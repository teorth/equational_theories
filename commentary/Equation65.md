## The "Asterix" equation

Closely related to the ["Obelix" equation, 1491](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1491).  In particular, [the "Asterix" and "Obelix" equations are equivalent for finite magmas, but neither implies the other for infinite ones](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-magma-constructions-chapter.html#asterix-section)!

Examples of models include the linear model `x ◇ y = ω y` (in any field with a cube root of unity), or `x ◇ y = y + 1` (in `ℤ/3ℤ`).
