This law implies [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x=x◇(x◇x)`.

If left multiplications are injective, then the magma is a quasigroup in which right multiplications are involutions (namely `(x◇y)◇y = x`) and `x = x◇(x◇x)`.  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` is then commutative (`x:y = y:x`) and its cubing maps are the identity (`x=x:(x:x)`), namely law 617 is parastrophically equivalent to the conjunction of law 8 and [law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).
