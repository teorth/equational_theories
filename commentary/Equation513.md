This law constrains each left multiplication independently.  It states that left multiplication by any given element is bijective and its fourth iterate is the identity.  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies the same law, `x = y : (y : (y : (y : x)))`.  The operation defined by `x ◆ y = x ◇ (x ◇ y)` satisfies [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16).
