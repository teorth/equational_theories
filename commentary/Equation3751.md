This law is equivalent to the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together with the [law 3722](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3722) (a law from the 1978 Putnam) that states that all elements of the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` square to themselves.
