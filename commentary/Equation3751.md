This law is equivalent to the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together with the [law 3722](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3722) (a law from the 1978 Putnam) that states that all elements of the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` square to themselves (hence the set of squares and the set of idempotents coincide with `P`).  In particular the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.

In a quasigroup this law is simply equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) together with the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
