## The natural central groupoid law

It was shown [by Knuth](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#knuth) that the dual law 26302 [characterizes](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#natural-central-groupoid) "natural central groupoids", which, up to isomorphisms, are Cartesian squares `S × S` with magma operation `(a,b) ∘ (c,d) = (b,c)`. These are special cases of central groupoids (Equation 168).  Since this structure is invariant under exchanging left and right operands of the magma operation and first and second factors in `S × S`, the law 19853 also characterizes natural central groupoids.
