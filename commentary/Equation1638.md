This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is injective and the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is idempotent (`C(C(x)) = C(x)`).

In a quasigroup, squaring is bijective, all right cubes are equal to the same element `(x◇x)◇x = e`, and `x ↦ x◇e` is the inverse bijection of `S`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
