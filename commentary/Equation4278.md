This law states that the products `_ ◇ (_ ◇ x)` only depend on `x`.

The sets of squares `x◇x`, of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`, and of right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` are submagmas, with the set of left cubes being contained in the other two.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law is `ℕ×List(Σ)'` where `ℕ={0,1,2,…}` and `List(Σ)'` consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ`, with the operation defined by `(i, [s, …, t]) ◇ (0, [u]) = (i, [s, …, t, u])`, and `(i, [s, …, t]) ◇ (j, [u]) = (j+1, [u])` for `j≥1`, and `_ ◇ (j, [u, …,v]) = (1, [v])` if the list in the second operand has at least two entries.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
