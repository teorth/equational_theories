This law can be written as `R(y) = L(y) ∘ R(y) ∘ L(y)` where `L(y): x ↦ y◇x` and `R(y): x ↦ x◇y` are left and right multiplication maps.

Among magmas whose right multiplication maps `R(y)` are bijective, this law is equivalent to the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)`.
