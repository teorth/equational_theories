## Hardy law

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective and right multiplications are injective.  In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, this law is equivalent to the
[Ramanujan law 1729](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1729) and [Littlewood law 2541](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2541).  Without such assumptions, the Ramanujan law 1729 implies the Littlewood law 2541, but no other implication holds.  For translation-invariant models, the Hardy law is a consequence of the Ramanujan law.

The laws 1729, 917, 2541 are twists of laws [125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125), [73](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?73), [229](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?229) by the squaring map.
