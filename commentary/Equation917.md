## "Hardy"

Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1).  It is open whether it implies (or implied by) "Ramanujan" [1729](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1729) or whether it implies "Littlewood" [2541](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2541), as well as special cases of those laws.  However, for translation-invariant models, "Hardy" is a consequence of "Ramanujan" , and all three laws are equivalent for finite models.
