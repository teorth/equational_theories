## "Hardy"

Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1).  It is open whether it implies "Ramanujan" [1729](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1729) or [2541](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2541), as well as special cases of those laws.  However, for translation-invariant models, 917 is a consequence of 1729, and the two laws are equivalent for finite models.
