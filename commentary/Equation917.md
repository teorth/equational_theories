## "Hardy"

Discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1).  It is open whether it is implied by "Ramanujan" [1729](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1729), though it does not imply "Ramanujan" or the related equation  "Littlewood" [2541](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2541).  However, for translation-invariant models, "Hardy" is a consequence of "Ramanujan" , and all three laws are equivalent for finite models.
