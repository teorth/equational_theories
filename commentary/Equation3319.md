This law is part of a [longest chain of implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Longest.20implication.20chain/near/521750611) 2 → … → 3715 → 326 → 3319 → 3253 → 1 between inequivalent laws of order up to 4.

In quasigroups (more generally when left multiplications are injective) this law is equivalent to [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x = x◇(x◇x)`.
