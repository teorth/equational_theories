## A law with an interesting infinite model

This law implies [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), namely left multiplications are involutions.

The dual of law 1133 is equivalent to [law 1661](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1661), [discussed in this thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1661.20-.3E.201657.20-.20another.20one.20bites.20the.20dust/near/476037184).  As discussed there, an interesting infinite model on the natural numbers can be used to generate a number of non-trivial anti-implications.
