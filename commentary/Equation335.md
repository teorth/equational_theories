This law is [Stein's first law](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00796), as named by Sade [1].  It implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent (`S(S(x))=S(x)`).

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

The free magma with one generator `x` for this law is a two-element magma `{x,x◇x}` with a constant law.
