This law implies the idempotence [law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x◇x=x`, as well as [law 9](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?9) `x◇(x◇y)=x` and [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) `x◇(y◇x)=x` and in particular a magma satisfying (the dual of) this law is necessarily a [travel groupoid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05510).

This law or its dual law 2499 are part of all [longest chains of implications](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Longest.20implication.20chain/near/521750611) such as 2 → 4 → 1037 → 1237 → 103 → 824 → 9 → 418 → 48 → 412 → 3 → 3715 → 326 → 307 → 3253 → 1 between inequivalent laws of order up to 4.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.

The free magma with two generators `0` and `1` for this law is `{0,1,2,3}` with `0◇1=2`, `1◇0=3` and all other `x◇y=x`.
