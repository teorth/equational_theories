This law is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).  The implication from law 650 to law 4 is one of the [hardest positive implications to prove](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/What.20are.20the.20hardest.20positive.20implications.20for.20an.20ATP.3F/near/484163341).  The task of finding an alternate proof of this implication was posed as a challenge [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving/topic/A.20.28semi.29-autoformalization.20challenge.3A.20650.3D.3E448/with/518733664).
