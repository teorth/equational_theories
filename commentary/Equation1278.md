This twist of [law 117](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?117) by the squaring map implies that left multiplications are surjective.

In a quasigroup, this law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is a morphism hence the set `im(S)` of squares is a sub-quasigroup.  In finite quasigroups satisfying this law, the size of `im(S)` appears to be very constrained: for `|M|≤8` the only possible value `(|M|, |im(S)|)` other than `(|M|, 1)` or `(|M|, |M|)` is `(8, 2)`.
