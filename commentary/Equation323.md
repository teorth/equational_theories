## A proto-unital shelf law

This law states that left multiplication by any given element is idempotent.

As defined [by Crans, Mukherjee, Przytycki](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08590), a proto-unital shelf is a magma satisfying the dual [law 378](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?378), together with the graphic [law 333](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?333) and the self-distributivity law 60491 (dual to [law 56085](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56085)).

On a set with n elements, the number of binary operations satisfying this law is the n-th power of [OEIS sequence A000248](https://oeis.org/A000248).
