## A crossed inverse quasigroup law

This law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `y◇(x◇y) = x` by an automorphism `f`, equal to the cube map `f(x) = x◇(x◇x)`.  It implies that the magma is a quasigroup that obeys

- the middle crossed inverse property `f(y)◇(x◇y)=x` or equivalently `(f(y)◇x)◇y=x` (which imply that `f(x◇y) = f(x)◇f(y)`);

- the left and right crossed inverse property stating that `(y◇x)◇y` and `y◇(x◇y)` are `y`-independent, specifically `(y◇x)◇y = f⁻¹(x)` and `y◇(x◇y) = f(x)`.

A different twist is [law 695](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?695), which only implies the middle but not the left/right crossed inverse properties.
