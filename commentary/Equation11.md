## The right-unit squares law

The magma operation is exactly characterized by the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`, which is idempotent (`S(S(x)) = S(x)`), and the operation `M × (M∖im(S)) → M`, as the operation on `M × im(S)` is left projection.  Squares are right units, hence form a submagma satisfying the left-zero [law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).

In a commutative magma this law is equivalent to stating that squares are all equal to the same identity element.  In a group it states that the group is a Boolean group (abelian group of exponent 2).
