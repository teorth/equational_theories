## The right-unit squares law

The magma operation is exactly characterized by the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`, which is idempotent (`S(S(x)) = S(x)`), and the operation `M × (M∖im(S)) → M`, as the operation on `M × im(S)` is left projection.  Squares are right units, hence form a submagma satisfying the left-zero [law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).

The analogues for squares, left cubes and right cubes are law 11, [law 56](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?56) and [law 108](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?108), and for different fourth powers are [law 440](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?440), [law 643](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?643), [law 846](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?846), [law 1049](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1049), and [law 1252](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1252).

In a commutative magma this law is equivalent to stating that squares are all equal to the same identity element.  In a group it states that the group is a Boolean group (abelian group of exponent 2).

Among quasigroups this law implies the [unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40) which states all squares are equal to the same element `e`.  Law 11 is parastrophically equivalent to the existence of a two-sided unit `e`, namely `◇` obeys law 11 if and only if the quasigroup equipped with the division operation `/` (defined by `(x/y)◇y=x`) is a loop (with `x = x/e = e/x`).
