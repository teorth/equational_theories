## A form of the constant law

This law is equivalent to the constant law, [Equation 46](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?46) (as well as 417 other laws).

A non-trivial law is implied by the constant law if and only if both sides of the law involve at least one application of the magma operation.  For instance, the commutative and associative laws are implied.

A magma subject to this law is equivalent to a pointed set.
