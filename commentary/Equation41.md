## A form of the constant law

This law is equivalent to the constant law, [Equation 46](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?46).  The equivalence class of this law is the second-largest one (419 laws in our list of 4694 laws).

A non-trivial law is implied by the constant law if and only if both sides of the law involve at least one application of the magma operation.  For instance, the commutative and associative laws are implied.

A magma subject to this law is also called a null semigroup.  It is equivalent to a pointed set.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is `S ⊔ {∞}` with constant law `x ◇ y = ∞`.
