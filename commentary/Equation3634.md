This law implies exactly the laws whose left-hand side and right-hand side have the same last two variables.  It is equivalent to the ["right-zero product" law 343](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?343) `x◇y = z◇(x◇y)` together with either one of the [associative law 4512](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4512) or [the reduction law 395](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?395).

A 3634-magma `M` is characterized by the set `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` (on which the operation reduces to right projection), and a collection of right-multiplication maps `R_x: P→P` for `x ∈ M∖P` with the compatibility condition that the image of each `R_x ∘ R_y` is a singleton, `{x◇y}`.

The set of squares coincides with the set of products and with the set of idempotent elements.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law is `Σ ⊔ Σ×Σ`, with the magma operation `s◇t=(s,t)`, `s◇(t,u)=(t,u)`, `(s,t)◇u=(t,u)`, `(s,t)◇(u,v)=(u,v)`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
