## The (dual of the) last survivor

The last implication to resist analysis for either the infinite or finite magma part of the project is the implication from law 677 to law 255 (dual to law 47) for finite models, which remains open.  See the commentary of [law 677](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?677&finite) for details.

Law 47 constrains each left-multiplication map independently: left multiplication by `x` either maps `x` to itself, or maps `x↦y↦z↦x` where `x,y,z` are pairwise distinct.
