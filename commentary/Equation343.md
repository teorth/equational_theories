## The "right-zero product" law

This law states that all products are right zeros, namely `w ◇ z = z` for any `w` and for `z` in the set of products `P = {x ◇ y | x,y ∈ M}`.  A magma satisfying this law is characterized by the subset `P ⊂ M` and a map `M × (M∖P) → P`, which is then completed to an operation `M × M → P` using the right projection on `M × P → P`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ`, with the operation `[s, …, t] ◇ [u, …, v] = [u, …, v]` when the second operand has more than one item, and otherwise `[s, …, t] ◇ [u] = [s, …, t, u]`.
