This law is [Stein's third law](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.disc.2012.08.013), as named by Sade [1].  It was also called the [bookend](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08502) property.  It implies that squaring is involutive ([law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151)).

The map `(x, y) ↦ (x◇y, y◇x)` is a bijection of order 4 on `M×M` and its square is `(x, y) ↦ (y, x)`.  This [helps determine the finite spectrum](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/near/526300502).

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative or associative magma.

If right multiplications are bijective, then right-division satisfies [law 117](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?117), namely laws 117 and 167 are parastrophically equivalent for (right-)quasigroups.  (Likewise, if left-division exists it satisfies law 209, dual to 117.)
