This law is [Stein's third law](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.disc.2012.08.013), as named by Sade [1].  It was also called the [bookend](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08502) property.

If right multiplications are bijective, then right-division satisfies [law 117](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?117), namely laws 117 and 167 are parastrophically equivalent for (right-)quasigroups.  (Likewise, if left-division exists it satisfies law 209, dual to 117.)
