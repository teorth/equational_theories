## The right-unit left cubes law

This law states that left cubes are right units (not necessarily equal) and in particular form a submagma (on which the operation reduces to left projection).

The analogues for squares, left cubes and right cubes are [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11), law 56 and [law 108](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?108), and for different fourth powers are [law 440](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?440), [law 643](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?643), [law 846](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?846), [law 1049](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1049), and [law 1252](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1252).

In left-quasigroups (where left multiplications are bijective) this law states that all left cubes are equal to the same right unit, and it is parastrophically equivalent to [law 50](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?50), in the sense that law 56 holds if and only if the left division operation defined by `x â—‡ (x : y) = y` obeys `x = x : (x : (y : y))`.
