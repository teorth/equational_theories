This law implies the equality of left and right cubes `x◇(x◇x) = (x◇x)◇x`, which form a submagma, and the set of squares is also a submagma.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`  `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  Any idempotent element (such as `S(S(x))`) is a left zero.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ`, with the operation defined by `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]` except for `[s] ◇ [s, s, v, …, w] = [s, s, v, …, w]`, and `[s, …, t] ◇ _ = [s, s, …, t]` when the first operand has at least two entries.
