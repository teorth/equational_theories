This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S`, with the operation defined by `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]` except for `[s] ◇ [s, s, v, …, w] = [s, s, v, …, w]`, and `[s, …, t] ◇ _ = [s, s, …, t]` when the first operand has at least two entries.
