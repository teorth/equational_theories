Denoting by `P = {x ◇ y | x,y∈M}`, this law implies that the operation restricted to `P × M` is left projection composed with the squaring function `S: P→P`, which is idempotent on this subset, namely `S(S(x◇y)) = S(x◇y)`.  It also implies that `x◇(y◇x) = S(x◇y)`.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
