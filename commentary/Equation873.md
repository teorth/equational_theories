This twist of the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) by the squaring map is obeyed in idempotent semi-symmetric quasigroups.  It implies that left multiplications are surjective and the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is injective.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial semigroup (associative magma).

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [conjecturally `{1,3,4,5}∪[7,+∞)`](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
