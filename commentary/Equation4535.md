This law is equivalent to [law 4577](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4577).   In terms of the submagma `P = {x ◇ y | x,y∈M}`, law 4577 states that `x ◇ p = p ◇ x = C(x)` for some (cubing) function `C: M → M` for any `x∈M` and `p∈P`.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
