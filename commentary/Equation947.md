This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and cubing maps `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` and `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` are bijections of order 3 with `S(x)=C(x)` and `x = B(C(x)) = C(B(x)) = B(B(B(x))) = C(C(C(x)))`.  It also implies that right multiplications square to constant maps (namely `(y◇x)◇x` is `y`-independent, equal to `C(x)`), and that left multiplications square to `B` (and in particular are bijective).

This law is equivalent to [law 723](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?723) together with [law 3897](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3897).

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` obeys law 42146, `y : (x : (y : (z : x))) = z : x`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
