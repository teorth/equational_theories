This law is equivalent to the [law 4379](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4379) stating that all three-fold products of the form `_ ◇ (_ ◇ _)` are equal to the same right zero element `e`.

The submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` is a left ideal.  The set of squares is a sub-ideal.  This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  The stronger [law 4526](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4526) is equivalent to associativity together with this law.

The magma is characterized by the pointed set `(P,e)`, the set `M∖P`, and an operation `M×(M∖P) → P`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of an element `∞` together with the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ`, with the product `[s, …, t] ◇ [u] = [s, …, t, u]` and all other products equal to `∞`.

The equivalence class of this law is among the largest ones (31 laws in our list of 4694 laws).
