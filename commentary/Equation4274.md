This law is equivalent to the [law 4379](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4379) stating that all three-fold products of the form `_ ◇ (_ ◇ _)` are equal.

Denoting `∞∈M` this element, and `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}`, the magma is characterized by the pointed set `(P,∞)`, the set `M∖P`, and an operation `M×(M∖P) → P`.

In particular, this law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of an element `∞` together with the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S`, with the product `[s, …, t] ◇ [u] = [s, …, t, u]` and all other products equal to `∞`.

The equivalence class of this law is among the largest ones (31 laws in our list of 4694 laws).

The stronger [law 4526](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4526) is equivalent to associativity together with this law.
