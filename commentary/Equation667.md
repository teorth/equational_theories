This law implies that left and right multiplications are surjective.  The operations defined by `x : y = y ◇ ((y ◇ y) ◇ x)` and `x / y = (x ◇ x) : (x : y)` obey `y ◇ (y : x) = x` and `(x / y) ◇ y = x`, hence they can serve as (not necessarily unique) left and right divisions.  In addition, `(y / x) : y = x`.

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [unknown](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
