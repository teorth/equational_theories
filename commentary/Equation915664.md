## The extra property for loops

For loops (unital magma whose left and right multiplications are invertible) the laws 915664 `x◇(y◇(z◇x))=((x◇y)◇z)◇x`, 920889 `x◇((y◇x)◇z)=(x◇y)◇(x◇z)` and its dual 936871, are equivalent, and characterize so-called extra loops, which are in particular Moufang loops.
