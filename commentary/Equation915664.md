## The extra property for loops

For loops (unital magma whose left and right multiplications are invertible) the laws 915664 `x◇(y◇(z◇x))=((x◇y)◇z)◇x`, [920889](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?920889) `x◇((y◇x)◇z)=(x◇y)◇(x◇z)` and its dual [936871](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?936871), are equivalent, and characterize so-called extra loops, which are in particular Moufang loops.
