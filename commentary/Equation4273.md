## The right crossed-inverse property

In the terminology of [1], the left crossed-inverse property (LCIP) and right crossed-inverse property (RCIP) state that `(y ◇ x) ◇ y` and `y ◇ (x ◇ y)` are independent of `y`, respectively.  The RCIP implies that the left cubing map `B:x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is a magma morphism, hence the set of left cubes forms a submagma.

The usual crossed inverse property (CIP) is dubbed middle crossed inverse property in [1] and cannot be expressed as an equational law.  It states that there exists a map `α: M → M` such that `(x ◇ y) ◇ α(x) = y`, which in a quasigroup is equivalent to `x ◇ (y ◇ α(x)) = y`, and equivalent to the existence of a map `ω` such that `(ω(x) ◇ y) ◇ x = y` and equivalently `ω(x) ◇ (y ◇ x) = y`, where the maps `α` and `ω` are bijective and inverses of each other.  Note that in their equation (1) `γ` stands successively for `α`, `α`, `ω`, `ω`.

Confusingly, since the definitions of crossed inverse property are no longer equivalent in magmas that are not quasigroups, other authors [2] have dubbed LCIP groupoid and RCIP groupoid the magmas that satisfy the first and last characterizations of CIP listed here.
