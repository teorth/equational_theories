This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is an involution.

It is implied by (and much weaker than) the [Sheffer stroke law 321577](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?321577).  Magmas satisfying the dual law 156 together with [law 166](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?166) were dubbed [Sheffer groupoids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12079).
