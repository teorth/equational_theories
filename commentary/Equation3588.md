## One member of an Austin pair of dual equations

It was shown as part of this project that [Equation 3588](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3588) is equivalent to its dual [Equation 3994](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3994) [for finite magmas](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-model-chapter.html#finite_imp_3994_3588), but [not for infinite magmas](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-model-chapter.html#non_imp_3994_3588_thm).
