## One member of an Austin pair of dual equations

It was shown as part of this project that [Equation 3588](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3588) is equivalent to its dual [Equation 3994](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3994) [for finite magmas](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-model-chapter.html#finite_imp_3994_3588), but [not for infinite magmas](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-model-chapter.html#non_imp_3994_3588_thm).

The submagma `P = {x ◇ y | x, y ∈ M}` is a semi-symmetric quasigroup, namely it obeys [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).  The operation restricted to `(M∖P) × P → P` and `P × (M∖P) → P` consists, for each `x ∈ M∖P`, of a pair of maps on `P` (left and right multiplications) whose composition (in one order) is the identity.  The operation restricted to `(M∖P) × (M∖P)` is only constrained to lie in `P`.

As a consequence, the images of both cubing maps `x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` and `x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` coincide with `P`.
