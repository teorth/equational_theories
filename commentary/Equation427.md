In left quasigroups (magmas whose left multiplications are bijective) this law implies that the left division operation defined by `x â—‡ (x : y) = y` satisfies [law 910](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?910), `x = y : ((y:x) : (y:y))`.  Conversely, magmas satisfying law 910 are left quasigroups whose left division satisfies 427.  Thus, laws 427 and 910 are parastrophically equivalent for (left-)quasigroups.
