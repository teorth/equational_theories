In left quasigroups (magmas whose left multiplications are bijective) this law holds if and only if the left division operation defined by `x â—‡ (x : y) = y` satisfies [law 910](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?910), `x = y : ((y:x) : (y:y))` (also equivalent in this context to [law 504](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?504), namely laws 427 and 910 (and 504) are parastrophically equivalent.
