This law implies that left multiplications are bijective and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(S(x))) = S(x)`.

The set of squares is a submagma satisfying [law 138](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?138).

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same element `e` which is central (namely `e◇x=x◇e`) and satisfies `x = (y◇e)◇(y◇x)`.  In particular it implies [law 1137](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1137).  Equivalently, the right division operation defined by `(x/y)◇y = x` satisfies `x/y = (y/x)/e` and `e/x=x` and `(x/e)/e=x` and `(x/e)/x = e`.
