This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 9](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?9) `x◇(x◇y)=x` and [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) `x◇(y◇x)=x` and implies that the magma operation is idempotent.

A magma satisfying the dual of this law is necessarily a [travel groupoid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05510).

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or (quasi)group.
