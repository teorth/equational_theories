This law states that products of the form `(x◇(x◇_))◇x` are right units.  It implies that right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` and squared squares `(x◇x)◇(x◇x)` are right units ([law 108](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?108) and [law 846](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?846)).  Thus, the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`  `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
