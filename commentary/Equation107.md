Among semigroups (associative magmas) this law is equivalent to [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) characterizing [rectangular bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_(algebra)).  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a quasigroup, this law implies that all squares are equal.
