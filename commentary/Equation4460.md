This law states that left and right cubes are equal, that left multiplications by squares are all equal to that cubing map, and that `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` only depends on `x`.

This law implies that the set of squares is a submagma.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
