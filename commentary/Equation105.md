This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).  It cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a left quasigroup this law is equivalent to stating that `(y◇x)◇y` is equal to the right-cube `C(x) = (x◇x)◇x` and that `x ◇ C(x) = x`.
