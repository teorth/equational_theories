This law states that all three-fold products of the form `(_ ◇ _) ◇ _` are equal to some element `∞` (as stated by [law 4589](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4589)), and that all cubes `x ◇ (x ◇ x)` are equal to the same element `∞`.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.
