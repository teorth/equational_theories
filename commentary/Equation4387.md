This law states that all three-fold products of the form `(_ ◇ _) ◇ _` are equal to some element `∞` (as stated by [law 4589](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4589)), and that all cubes `x ◇ (x ◇ x)` are equal to the same element `∞`.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  The set of squares is a submagma.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of an element `∞` together with the set of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ` whose last three elements may not be equal, with the product `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]` except `[s] ◇ [s, s] = ∞`, and all other products equal to `∞`.
