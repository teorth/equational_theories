## Equation 374794 `x = (((y ◇ y) ◇ y) ◇ x) ◇ ((y ◇ y) ◇ z)`: An Austin law
It was shown [by Kisielewicz](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#Kisielewicz) that this law is an Austin law: [it has no non-trivial finite models, but it has an infinite model](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-model-chapter.html#kis-thm).
