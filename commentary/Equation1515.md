This law implies that the left cubing map `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` is injective and the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is surjective, with `C(B(x)) = x`.  In a finite magma, they are bijections, and additionally one has `(y◇y)◇x = C(x)` independently of `y`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same element `e` such that `x = e◇(x◇e)`.
