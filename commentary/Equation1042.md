This law implies that squares are right units ([law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) `x = x◇(y◇y)`) but cannot be left units since [law 107](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?107) `x = x ◇ ((y◇y) ◇ x)` holds.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
