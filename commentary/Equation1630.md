This law implies that the squaring and left cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` satisfy `B(S(x)) = x` (hence `S` is injective and `B` surjective).  In a finite magma, `B` and `S` are inverse bijections and `x◇(x◇y)` is `y`-independent (and equal to `B(x)`).

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
