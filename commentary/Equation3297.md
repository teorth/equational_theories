This law implies the [unipotent law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40): all squares are equal to the same idempotent element `e`.  In addition, `x ◇ (x ◇ e) = e` and `x ◇ (y ◇ (y ◇ x)) = e`.

In quasigroups (more generally when left multiplications are injective) this law is equivalent to [the involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)` together with the unipotence law 40.
