## The central groupoid law

This law defines central groupoids, which are magmas with some interesting combinatorial structure. For instance, all finite central groupoids have a cardinality that is necessarily a square number. [This paper of Knuth](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#knuth) establishes many of the basic properties of these objects.  This paper also helped inspire the creation of the [Knuth--Bendix completion algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Bendix_completion_algorithm).
