## The central groupoid law

This law defines central groupoids, which are magmas with some interesting combinatorial structure. For instance, all finite central groupoids have a cardinality that is necessarily a square number. [This paper of Knuth](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#knuth) establishes many of the basic properties of these objects.
