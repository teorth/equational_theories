In a magma satisfying this law, one can define an unoriented graph with an edge `x-y` whenever `x ◇ y = x` (which is equivalent to `y ◇ x = y`), and in particular a loop `x-x` for each idempotent element.  The magma is characterized by that graph and, for each element `x`, a right-multiplication that maps every non-neighbor of `x` to a neighbor of `x`.

Among semigroups (associative magmas) this law characterizes [rectangular bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_(algebra)).
