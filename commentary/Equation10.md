In a magma satisfying this law, one can define an unoriented graph with an edge `x-y` whenever `x ◇ y = x` (which is equivalent to `y ◇ x = y`), and in particular a loop `x-x` for each idempotent element.  The magma is characterized by that graph and, for each element `x`, a right-multiplication that maps every non-neighbor of `x` to a neighbor of `x`.

Among semigroups (associative magmas) this law characterizes [rectangular bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_(algebra)).  It cannot hold in any (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.

The dual [law 25](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?25), dubbed contraction, holds in [implication algebras](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43679502) and [travel groupoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05510) (see also [law 428](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?428)).  The law 25 characterizes De Morgan algebras [among implication zroupoids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10559).
