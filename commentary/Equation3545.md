In a quasigroup (more generally if left multiplications are injective), this law is equivalent to the commutative [law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together with [law 23](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?23) `x = (x◇x)◇x`.

It admits a [13-element model](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Shrinking.20the.20size-232.20magma.20for.20law.201518.20to.20size.2015/near/554071199) whose left and right cosets all have 9 elements, which satisfies only this law and its consequences, and no other law of order up to 4.
