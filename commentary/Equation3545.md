In a quasigroup (more generally if left multiplications are injective), this law is equivalent to the commutative [law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together with [law 23](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?23) `x = (x◇x)◇x`.

It admits a 17-element model whose left and right cosets all have 10 elements, which satisfies only this law and its consequences, and no other law of order up to 4.  This model is the largest one found purely by an automated tool (Vampire).
