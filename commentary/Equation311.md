Magmas satisfying this law are characterized by the subset `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}`, the operation restricted to `◇: M × M∖P → P`, and the restriction of the squaring map to `S: P → P`.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `S ⊔ {∞}` without `∞` in first or second positions, equipped with the operation `[s] ◇ [t] = [s, t]` and `[s1, …, sn] ◇ [t] = [s1, …, sn, t]` and `[s] ◇ [t1, …, tm] = [s, s]` and `[s1, …, sn] ◇ [t1, …, tm] = [s1, …, sn, ∞]` (for operands with at least two entries).
