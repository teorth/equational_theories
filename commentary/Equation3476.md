This law implies the [right-zero unipotence law 316](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?316): all squares are equal to an element `e` that is a right zero, namely `x ◇ e = e`.  In addition, all products of the form `x ◇ ((_ ◇ x) ◇ z)` are equal to `e`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
