This law states that products `x◇(_◇_)` only depend on `x`.  The submagma `P={x◇y|x,y∈M}` is a submagma that obeys the [left unar law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38), with the operation taking values in the set of squares, which is itself a submagma of `P`.

The set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`, or equivalently of all products `_◇(_◇_)`, is another submagma.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
