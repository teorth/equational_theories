This law is equivalent to stating that `x ◇ (_ ◇ x)` and `(x ◇ _) ◇ _` only depend on `x` and are equal.

This law implies that the set of squares, and the set of cubes, are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`  `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

The magma admits at least one left zero element.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law consists of finite non-empty lists of elements of `Σ` whose last and third-to-last elements may only be equal if the list consists of three equal elements, equipped with the operation defined by `[s] ◇ [t, t, t] = [s, s, s]` and `[s] ◇ [t, s] = [s, s, s]` and otherwise `[s] ◇ [t, …, u] = [s, t, …, u]`, and `[s, …, t] ◇ _ = [s, s, s]` when the first operand has at least two entries.
