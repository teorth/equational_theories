This law implies that left multiplications are surjective and right multiplications are injective.  In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, it is equivalent to its dual, [law 2534](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2534).

The operation `x ◆ y = x ◇ (y ◇ x)` satisfies the [involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16), `x=y◆(y◆x)`.
