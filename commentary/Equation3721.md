This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.  It also implies that the set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)` is a submagma.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same right-unit element `e`, namely `x = x ◇ e`.
