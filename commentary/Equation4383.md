This law is equivalent to stating that right multiplications all square to the same map and that left and right cubes are equal.

The set of cubes forms a submagma.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x = x◇(x◇x)` together with the [involutive right multiplication law 26](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?26) `x = (x◇y)◇y`.
