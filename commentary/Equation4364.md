This law is called [cyclic associativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0991).  The dual law 4679 is also called [cyclic associativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10825).

The set of squares, the set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`, and the set of right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` are submagmas.

Quasigroups satisfying this law are abelian groups equipped with addition.

This law together with the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) is equivalent to idempotence, commutativity, and associativity.  An idempotent magma satisfying this law is thus precisely a semilattice (poset equipped with a finite join or meet operation).  This law and idempotence form a 2-basis of the equational law of the magma `{0,1}` equipped with `x◇y=min(x,y)`.  The same property holds for idempotent magmas satisfying the dual law 4679 or [law 4541](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4541) `x◇(y◇z) = (z◇x)◇y`.
