This law is called [cyclic associativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0991).  The dual law 4679 is also called [cyclic associativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10825).

The set of squares, the set of left cubes `x◇(x◇x)`, and the set of right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` are submagmas.

Quasigroups satisfying this law are abelian groups equipped with addition.
