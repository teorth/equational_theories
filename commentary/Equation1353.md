This law implies that left multiplications are bijective and that squaring is involutive ([law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151)).  The left division operation defined by `x â—‡ (x : y) = y`  law 43900, `x : y = z : ((y : z) : (x : y))`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
