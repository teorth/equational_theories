This law implies that left multiplications are bijective and that squaring is involutive ([law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151)).  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies [law 43900](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43900), `x : y = z : ((y : z) : (x : y))`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
