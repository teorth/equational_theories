## The group division law (Higman-Neumann axiom)

This axiom characterizes division in a (not necessarily abelian) group, as was [worked out by Higman and Neumann in 1952](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=57866). It is one of the [shortest such axioms](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/projects/gtsax/).

This law is equivalent to a pair of order-4 laws: [law 3737](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3737) together with either [law 1718](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1718) or the weaker [law 1731](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1731).  Among quasigroups (or more generally magmas whose left multiplications are surjective), law 3737 (namely `x◇y = (x◇z)◇(y◇z)`) suffices.
