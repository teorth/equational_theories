## The Higman-Neumann axiom

This axiom characterizes division in a (not necessarily abelian) group, as was [worked out by Higman and Neumannin in 1956](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=57866). It is one of the [shortest such axioms](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/projects/gtsax/).
