## The group division law (Higman-Neumann axiom)

This axiom characterizes division in a (not necessarily abelian) group, as was [worked out by Higman and Neumann in 1956](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=57866). It is one of the [shortest such axioms](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/projects/gtsax/).

Among quasigroups (magma such that left multiplication or right multiplication by any given element is bijective), the simpler [law 3737](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3737) is equivalent to the Higman-Neumann axiom.
