This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

In a left quasigroup, this law holds if and only if the left division operation defined by `xâ—‡(x:y) = y` satisfies [law 467](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?467), `x = y:(x:(x:(y:y)))`, namely the two laws are parastrophically equivalent.
