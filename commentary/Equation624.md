This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.  Equivalently, squares are idempotent, namely `x◇x` squares to itself.  The set of squares (or equivalently of idempotents) is a right ideal of the magma, in the sense that `(x◇x)◇y` is a square for any `x,y∈M`.  Thus, the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` has the same image as `S`.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or (quasi)group.
