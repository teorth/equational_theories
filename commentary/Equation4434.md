This law is equivalent to stating that left and right cubes are equal, and that `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` and `(x ◇ x) ◇ y` only depend on `x`.

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes `x◇(x◇x) = (x◇x)◇x` are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
