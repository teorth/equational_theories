This law states that products `y ◇ (x ◇ x)` and `(y ◇ z) ◇ x` are equal and only depend on `x`.

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` satisfies `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  Any idempotent element (such as `S(S(x))`) is a right zero.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
