## A mysterious "twinned" equation.

This equation is "twinned" with [Equation 124](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?124), in that it seems to imply, and be implied by, exactly the same set of equations, without being equivalent.  There is currently [no explanation for this phenomenon](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Numerical.20coincidence.3A.20476.20~.20503).
