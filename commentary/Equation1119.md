## A mysterious "twinned" equation.

This equation is "twinned" with [Equation 124](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?124), in that it seems to imply, and be implied by, exactly the same set of equations, without being equivalent.  There is currently [no complete explanation for this phenomenon](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Numerical.20coincidence.3A.20476.20~.20503), though [some hints of an explanation have emerged through analysis of linear models](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Twin.20pairs.20of.20equations).

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective and squaring is involutive ([law 151](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?151)).

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.

The free magma with one generator `x` for this law is a two-element magma `{x,x◇x}`.
