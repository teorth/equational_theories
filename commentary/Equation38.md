## The left unar law

This law states that the magma operation is left-projection composed with squaring, namely `x◇y = S(x)` where `S: x ↦ x◇x`.  Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with sets equipped with an endofunction (self-map).

Any law that implies this law or its dual (laws 4, 5, 13, 24, 38, 39, 41, 62, 256, 336, 374, 463, 3051, 3359, 4117 and higher-order laws) describes sets equipped with a self-map subject to a condition.  The equivalence class of this law is among the largest ones (40 laws in our list of 4694 laws), and a full 57% of the 4694 laws imply either law 38 or law 39.

This law cannot hold in any non-trivial quasigroup.  In a commutative magma it is equivalent to the constant law.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to [law 374](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?374).  Magmas satisfying this law are always submagmas of linear magmas satisfying this law.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law is `ℕ×Σ` with `S(m,s)=(m+1,s)`, namely `(m,s) ◇ (n,t) = (m+1,s)`.

The number of magmas of size n (modulo isomorphism) satisfying this law is [OEIS sequence A001372](https://oeis.org/A001372).
