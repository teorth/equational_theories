## The left unar law

This law states that the magma operation is left-projection composed with squaring, namely `x◇y = f(x)` where `f: x ↦ x◇x`.  Such magmas are in one-to-one correspondence with sets equipped with an endofunction (self-map).

Any law that implies this law (laws 4, 24, 41, 256, 374, 3051, 4117, …) describes sets equipped with a self-map subject to a condition.

The free magma on some set `S` of generators for this law is `ℕ×S` with `f(m,s)=(m+1,s)`, namely `(m,s) ◇ (n,t) = (m+1,s)`.

The equivalence class of this law is among the largest ones (40 laws in our list of 4694 laws).

The number of magmas of size n (modulo isomorphism) satisfying this law is [OEIS sequence A001372](https://oeis.org/A001372).
