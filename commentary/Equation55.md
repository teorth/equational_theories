Among quasigroups (more generally if right multiplications are injective or surjective), this law is equivalent to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) `x=x◇x` together with the [involutive left multiplications law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x=y◇(y◇x)`.

Among left-quasigroups, where only left multiplications are bijective, this law is equivalent to [law 72](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?72) which states that the squaring map `S:x ↦ x◇x` is bijective and that all left multiplications square to its inverse.

Among semigroups (associative magmas) this law is equivalent to [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) characterizing [rectangular bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_(algebra)).  It cannot hold in a (non-trivial) group.
