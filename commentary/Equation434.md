This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 10](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?10) and [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) (squares are right units).

In a magma satisfying this law, one can define an unoriented graph with an edge `x-y` whenever `x ◇ y = x` (which is equivalent to `y ◇ x = y`), and in particular a loop `x-x` for each idempotent element.  The magma is characterized by the squaring map, the graph (with a loop for each idempotent element and an edge between every square and every element), and, for each (non-square) element `x`, a right-multiplication that maps every non-neighbor of `x` to a neighbor of `x`.
