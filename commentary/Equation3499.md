This law implies the [right zeropotence law 312](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?312) `x ◇ x = y ◇ (x ◇ x)`, namely all squares are right zeros.

The set of idempotent elements, the set of squares, and the set of right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` coincide.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
