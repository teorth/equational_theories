This law states that products of the form `((x◇_)◇x)◇x` are right units.  It implies that right cubes `(x◇x)◇x` are right units ([law 108](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?108)) and products of the form `((x◇x)◇x)◇_` as well.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
