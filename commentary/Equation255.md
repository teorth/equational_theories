## The last survivor

The last implication to resist analysis for either the infinite or finite magma part of the project is the implication from [law 677](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?677&finite) to this law for finite models, which remains open.  It is discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/FINITE.3A.20677.20-.3E.20255).  It is immune to linear models and the cohomological approach.  On the other hand, law 255 would follow from right cancellability, and even from the existence, for all `x`, of an element `y` such that `y â—‡ x = x`.
