## A law for affine Gaussian modules

A magma satisfying this law is a ℤ[√-1]-module equipped with the operation `x◇y  = -x + (√-1) y + c` for some constant `c`.  It is in particular a quasigroup (left and right multiplication are bijective).  The ℤ[√-1]-module structure is only fixed up to a choice of zero element.

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies [law 556](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?556).  Conversely, a magma satisfying law 556 is a quasigroup and its left division satisfies law 546, so the two laws are parastrophically equivalent.  They share the same finite spectrum (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying the law): all [sums of two squares](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/526300502).
