This law implies that left multiplication maps commute, namely [law 4362](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4362) `x◇(y◇z) = y◇(x◇z)` holds.

All left multiplications square to the same map `B:x ↦ x◇(x◇x)`, which is idempotent and whose image is the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` (in particular one has `B(x◇y) = x◇y`).  The set of left multiplication maps restricted to `P` forms a Boolean subgroup (abelian group of exponent 2) of the group of bijections of `P`.
