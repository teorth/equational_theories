This law implies that the squaring and left cubing maps `S: x ↦ x◇x` and `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` are inverse bijections, but also that the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is a bijection, as well as all fourth-power and fifth-power maps.

Despite these numerous relations between powers, the free magma with one generator is infinite.  See the commentary on the stronger [law 1465](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1465) (which has a smaller free magma) for an infinite quotient.

In any linear model, any submagma generated by a single element is either `ℤ/6ℤ` equipped with `x◇y = 3x+4y-1`, or a quotient of it.

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
