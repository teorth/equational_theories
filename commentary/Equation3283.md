This law implies the [right-zero unipotent law 316](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?316): all squares are equal to the same element `e` which is a right zero, namely `x ◇ e = e`.  In addition, left multiplications cube to the constant map equal to `e`, namely `x ◇ (x ◇ (x ◇ y)) = e`.
