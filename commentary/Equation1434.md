This law is a twist of [law 55](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?55) by the squaring map.

In a quasigroup, this law implies [law 8](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?8) `x = x◇(x◇x)` and [law 23](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?23) `x = (x◇x)◇x`.
