## The Steiner loop ("sloop") law

This can also be called the totally-symmetric loop law.  This law is equivalent to the [totally-symmetric quasigroup law](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492) together with the fact that all squares are equal to the same element `e` ([law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)).  The element `e` is then a two-sided identity, and every element has an inverse (itself).

Such magmas `M` are in one-to-one correspondence with Steiner triple systems on `M∖{e}`, with the operation defined by `x ◇ x = e`, `x ◇ e = e ◇ x = x`, and `x ◇ y = z` (and all permutations thereof) whenever `x,y,z` form a triple.

The lowest-numbered laws characterizing Steiner loops are 63702, [63747](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?63747), [63942](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?63942), but there are numerous others of that order.

An associative sloop is the same as a Boolean group (abelian group of exponent 2), characterized by [law 895](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?895).
