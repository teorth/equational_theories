This law is equivalent to [law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) (left multiplications are involutions) together with either one of three conditions: existence of a right unit, or [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) (right-unit squares law), or [law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40) (unipotence).  All squares are equal to the right unit.

The left division operation defined by `x â—‡ (x : y) = y` satisfies the same law.

A magma satisfying the dual law 3147 is in particular an implication groupoid.
