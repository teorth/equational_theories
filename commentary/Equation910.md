This law implies that all left multiplications are bijective.  The left division operation defined by `x â—‡ (x : y) = y` obeys [law 427](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?427), `x = x : (y : (x : (x : y)))`, namely laws 427 and 910 are parastrophically equivalent.  (Likewise, in a magma satisfying law 427, if left-division exists it satisfies law 910.)
