This law implies that all left multiplications are bijective.  The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` (or equivalently `x : y = (x ◇ y) ◇ (x ◇ x)`) obeys [law 427](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?427), `x = x : (y : (x : (x : y)))`.  Conversely, in a magma satisfying law 427, if left multiplications are bijective, then left division satisfies law 910.  Thus, laws 427 and 910 are parastrophically equivalent for (left-)quasigroups.

This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 504](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?504) and [law 1925](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1925).  In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, these three laws individually are equivalent.  Without such assumptions, law 910 implies law 504 and law 1925, but no other implication holds.

This law is a twist of [law 125](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?125) by the squaring map.
