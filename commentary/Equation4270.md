This law states that right multiplications by any square coincide, namely `x ◇ (y ◇ y)` is independent of `y`.  The set of squares is a submagma that satisfies the [left unar law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38).

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)).
