## The singleton law

This is the strongest law, satisfied only by the trivial magmas: the singleton and empty magmas. Many laws are equivalent to this law; informally, they are so "overdetermined" that they can only be satisfied by trivial magmas. In fact, from our list of 4694 laws, exactly 1495 other laws are equivalent to this one.
