## The singleton law

This is the strongest law, satisfied only by the trivial magmas: the singleton and empty magmas. Many laws are equivalent to this law; informally, they are so "overdetermined" that they can only be satisfied by trivial magmas. In fact, from our list of 4694 laws, exactly 1495 other laws are equivalent to this one.

The free magma on some set `Σ` of generators for this law only exists if `Σ` is (empty or) a singleton, in which case the magma is `Σ` itself.
