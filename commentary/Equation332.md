This law implies that the magma operation is commutative.

The squaring operation `x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent and the magma operation is characterized by its action on squares in the sense that `x◇y=(x◇x)◇(y◇y)`.  However, the set of squares is not necessarily stable under the magma operation.

The free magma with one generator `x` for this law is a two-element magma `{x,x◇x}` with a constant law.
