This equation [admits an unusually large finite magma](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Outstanding.20equations.2C.20v1/near/478094170) (of order 12), that can be used to disprove some implications.  Magmas with this law are somewhat "mutable" in practice; one can modify a few entries of the multiplication table, and can sometimes add or remove some elements and still retain the law.
