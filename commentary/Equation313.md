This twist of the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) by the squaring map implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is an idempotent endomorphism, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)` and `S(x◇y)=S(x)◇S(y)`.  The image of S is thus a submagma that is an idempotent semi-symmetric quasigroup (aka Mendelsohn quasigroup, characterized by [law 4961](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4961)).

In a (left) quasigroup, law 313 is equivalent to law 4961, namely to the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3) together with the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x=y◇(x◇y)`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
