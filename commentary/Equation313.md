This twist of the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) by the squaring map implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is an idempotent endomorphism, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)` and `S(x◇y)=S(x)◇S(y)`.  The image of S is thus a submagma that is an idempotente semi-symmetric quasigroup (aka Mendelsohn quasigroup, [law 4961](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4961)).

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial group.
