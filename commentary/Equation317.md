This law implies the [right-zero unipotence law 316](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?316), namely all squares are equal to an element `e` that is a right zero, namely `xâ—‡e=e`, and that each left multiplication squares to the map that is constant equal to `e`.  Once the unipotent element `e` is chosen, the law constrains left multiplications independently.

This law cannot hold in any non-trivial quasigroup.
