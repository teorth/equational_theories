This law implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to the [totally symmetric quasigroup law 492](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?492), namely to law 43 together with the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)`.
