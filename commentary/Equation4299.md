This law states that all products of the form `x ◇ (x ◇ _)` and `_ ◇ (x ◇ x)` are equal to the same element `∞`.  The magma is characterized by the set of squares `Q = {x ◇ x | x ∈ M} containing `∞` and, for each `x ∈ M`, a left-multiplication map `L(x) : M → M` that maps `∞` to itself, `x` to an element of `Q`, and the remaining elements in such a way that `L(x) ∘ L(x)` is the constant map equal to `∞`.

In particular, this law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(x)) = ∞` hence `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
