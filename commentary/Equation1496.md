## A middle crossed inverse quasigroup law

This law is a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `y◇(x◇y) = x` by an automorphism `f`, as follows.  The law implies that the magma is a quasigroup and that

- all squares are equal to an element `e` that obeys `e◇(x◇e) = (e◇x)◇e = x`,
- `f(x) = x◇e` is an automorphism with `f(e) = e`,
- the middle crossed inverse property `y◇(x◇f(y))=x` holds, or equivalently `(y◇x)◇f(y)=x`.
