## Dual of the non-associative-permutative law

Its dual law, [4673](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4673) is described by the NAP operad, which has a nice closed description using the species of rooted trees. Equivalently, the free NAP algebras can be described using rooted trees.

Equivalently, this law states that left multiplications commute.  It is also called the right-normal law, or left-permutability, or left-commutativity, or the exchange law (in the context of [implication algebras](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43679502)).  Its dual law 4673 is one of the conditions defining [Novikov algebras](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02238).

Algebras that obey the two dual laws 4362 and 4673 are called bicommutative, or LR algebras.  A magma that obeys law 4362 and [law 4684](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4684) is an AG**-groupoid.
