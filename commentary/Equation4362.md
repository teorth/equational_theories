## Dual of the non-associative-permutative law

Its dual law, [4673](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4673) is described by the NAP operad, which has a nice closed description using the species of rooted trees. Equivalently, the free NAP algebras can be described using rooted trees.

Equivalently, this law states that left multiplications commute.  It is also called the right-normal law, or left-permutability, or left-commutativity.  Its dual is one of the conditions defining [Novikov algebras](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02238).

Algebras that obey the two laws 4362 and 4673 are called bicommutative, or LR algebras.
