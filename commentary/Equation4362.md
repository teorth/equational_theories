## Dual of the non-associative-permutative law

Its dual law, [4673](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4673) is described by the NAP operad, which has a nice closed description using the species of rooted trees. Equivalently, the free NAP algebras can be described using rooted trees.

Equivalently, this law states that left multiplications commute.
