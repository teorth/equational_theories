## The last survivor

See [this chapter of the blueprint](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/677-chapter.html).

This equation is the last one to resist analysis for either the infinite or finite magma part of the project.  The implication to [Equation 255](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?255&finite) for finite models remains open, and is discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/FINITE.3A.20677.20-.3E.20255).  It is immune to linear models and the cohomological approach.  On the other hand, 255 would follow from right cancellability, and even from the existence, for all `x`, of an element `y` such that `y â—‡ x = x`.

This law implies that left multiplications are surjective.  For finite magmas they are thus bijective.  This law cannot hold in a non-trivial semigroup (associative magma).

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law is [unknown](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).
