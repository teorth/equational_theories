## The last survivor

This equation is the last one to resist analysis for either the infinite or finite magma part of the project.  The implication to [Equation 255](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?255&finite) for finite models remains open, and is discussed [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/FINITE.3A.20677.20-.3E.20255).  It is immune to linear models, and surprisingly resistant to the cohomological approach.  On the other hand, 255 would follow from right cancellability.
