## A law for which greedy completion barely works

This is one of the laws where greedy completion has been shown (via extensive SAT-solver calculations) to work, but only barely.  As such, the proof of anti-implications from these laws could be extremely lengthy, to the extent that Lean may struggle to verify them.  See [this discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/1076.20!.3D.3E.203/near/476933251).

In finite magmas, or if left multiplications are assumed to be bijective, its dual law 2338 is equivalent to [law 511](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?511) and [law 714](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?714).
