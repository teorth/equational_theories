This law implies that squares form a submagma satisfying the [left unar law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38) `s◇t = s◇s`, and in fact this submagma is a left ideal since `x◇t = x◇x` for any square `t`.  The magma operation can be described by the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` and the operation restricted to `M × (M ∖ im(S))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
