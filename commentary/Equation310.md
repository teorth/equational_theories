This law implies that squares form a submagma satisfying the [left unar law 38](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?38).  The magma operation can be described by the squaring map `S` and the operation restricted to `M × (M ∖ im(S))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
