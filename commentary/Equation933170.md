## The "rumple" law

Quasigroups in which squaring is bijective and this law holds, [called rumples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02148), are in one-to-one correspondence with a class of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.

This law, together with the contraction [law 25](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?25) `x = (x◇y)◇x` and the two-variable order-8 law stating that `((x◇y)◇(y◇x))◇x` is symmetric in `x` and `y`, characterizes [quasi-implication algebras](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02483861).
