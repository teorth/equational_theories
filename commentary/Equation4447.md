This law is equivalent to stating that all products `x ◇ (y ◇ x)` and all products `(x ◇ x) ◇ y` are equal to the same element `∞` that is a left and right zero (`∞◇x = x◇∞ = x`).

This law implies that the set of squares is a submagma and that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x`  `S(S(x)) = ∞` so `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

This law cannot hold in a non-trivial quasigroup.
