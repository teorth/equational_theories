This law states that products of the form `x◇((y◇x)◇y)` are right units.  It implies [law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11) (squares are right units).

For quasigroups, this law is equivalent to the semi-symmetric loop [law 887](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?887) and in particular all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same two-sided unit element.
