This law is equivalent to stating that left and right cubes are equal ([law 4380](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4380)), that left multiplications by squares are all equal ([law 4590](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4590), namely `(y◇y)◇x` is `y`-independent), and that all left multiplications square to the same map ([law 4275](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4275), namely `y◇(y◇x)` is `y`-independent).

This law implies that the set of squares and the set of cubes are submagmas.  The squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating the [involutive left multiplication law 16](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?16) `x = y◇(y◇x)` and that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same two-sided unit element.
