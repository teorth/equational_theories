This law implies the [unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40), namely all squares are equal to the same element `e`.

In a quasigroup this law is equivalent to the unipotence law 40 and the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).
