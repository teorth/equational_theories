This law is equivalent to the conjunction of [law 4270](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4270) which states that right multiplications by any square coincide and [law 4275](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4275) which states that left multiplications all square to the same map.

This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` squares to a constant map (`S(S(x)) = S(S(y))`) hence obeys `S(S(S(x))) = S(S(x))`.  It also implies that squares form a submagma, and that left cubes `x◇(x◇x)` form a submagma.
