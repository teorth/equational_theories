A magma satisfying this law is a linear model on a Boolean group (abelian group of exponent 2) with an operation `x◇y = - b³ x + by + c` in which `b` is an endomorphism whose seventh power is the identity, and `c` an element of the group such that `(1+b+b²+b⁴)c=0`.  In particular the magma is a quasigroup (left and right multiplications are bijections) and left and right cubing maps are bijective.

The finite spectrum of (cardinalities of finite magmas satisfying) this law consists of [the powers of 2](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Order.203.20Spectra/with/527073087).

This law is equivalent to the dual of the Schröder identity of generalized associativity `x = (y ◇ z) ◇ (z ◇ (x ◇ y))` (law 1587).

As proven by Pushkashu [1], if the magma has a left-identity element, then it is an abelian group of exponent 2.
