This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.  This law together with associativity is equivalent to the [left-projection law 4](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4).

The free magma with one generator for this law has two elements since the law implies `x ◇ (x ◇ x) = x` and `(x ◇ x) ◇ x = x ◇ x` and `(x ◇ x) ◇ (x ◇ x) = x ◇ x`.  In particular, the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x)) = S(x)`.
