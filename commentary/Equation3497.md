This law states that all squares are equal to the same idempotent element ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) and all products of the form `x ◇ ((y ◇ x) ◇ y)` are equal to it too.

In a quasigroup this law is equivalent to the [semi-symmetric loop law 887](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?887), namely to law 40 together with [law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14) `x = y◇(x◇y)`.
