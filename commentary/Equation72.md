This law states that the squaring map `S:x ↦ x◇x` is bijective and cubes to the identity (`S(S(S(x)))=x`), and that all left multiplications square to the inverse of `S` (and in particular are bijective).

The left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies [law 55](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?55), namely `x = x : (y : (y : x))`.  Conversely, in a magma satisfying law 55, if left multiplications are bijective, then left division satisfies law 72.  Thus, laws 72 and 55 are parastrophically equivalent.
