This law implies that the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` is a quasigroup equipped with an involutive automorphism `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` (that maps `x◇y` to `y◇x`), and obeys [law 1073](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1073) `p = q◇(B(p)◇q)` for `p,q∈P`, a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law.
