This law implies that the submagma `P = {x◇y|x,y∈M}` is a quasigroup equipped with an involutive automorphism `B: x ↦ x◇(x◇x)` (that maps `x◇y` to `y◇x`), and  [law 1073](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1073) `p = q◇(B(p)◇q)` for `p,q∈P`, a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law.

The right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is equal to `B ∘ B`.  The images of `B` and `C` are both equal to the submagma `P`.

In a quasigroup this law is simply equivalent to law 1073.
