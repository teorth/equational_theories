This law states that squares are right units within the submagma `P={x◇y|x,y∈M}`, namely this submagma satisfies the [right-unit squares law 11](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?11).  In particular the squares form a submagma of `P`, and the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is idempotent, namely `S(S(x))=S(x)`.

In a quasigroup, this law is equivalent to stating that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) to the same right-unit element `e`, namely `x = x ◇ e`.
