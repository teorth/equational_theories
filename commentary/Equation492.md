## The totally-symmetric quasigroup law

This law is equivalent to the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together with the [Putnam law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).  Equivalently, the magma is a totally-symmetric quasigroup, in the sense that left and right divisions coincide with multiplication, which is commutative.

As [discussed here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Simple.20and.20.28sub.29directly.20irreducible.20spectrum/near/494707714), such "commutative Putnam magmas" include two particularly interesting subclasses:

- Idempotent totally-symmetric quasigroups, called Steiner quasigroups, or *squags*, which are fully characterized by [law 4964](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4964);

- Unital totally-symmetric quasigroups, called Steiner loops, or *sloops*, which are fully characterized by [law 63702].
