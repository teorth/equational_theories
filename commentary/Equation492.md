## A commutative version of the Putnam law 14

This law is equivalent to the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43) together with the [Putnam law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).  As [discussed here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Simple.20and.20.28sub.29directly.20irreducible.20spectrum/near/494707714), such "commutative Putnam magmas" include two particularly interesting subclasses: *squags*, which obey the [idempotence law 3](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?3), and *sloops*, which have a unit element.  In short, squags are idempotent 492-magmas, and sloops are unital 492-magmas.
