## The "Dupont" equation

Closely related to the ["Dupond" equation, 1692](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1692).  In particular, the two equations are equivalent for finite magmas, but [neither implies the other for infinite ones](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/infinite-magma-constructions-chapter.html#dupont-section).  See [this discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Proposed.20new.20target.3A.2063.20and.201692.20.28.22Dupont.20and.20Dupond.22.29).

This pair shares many similarities with the "Asterix" ([equation 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65)) and "Obelix" ([equation 1491](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1491)) pair.

As observed by Belousov [1], in a quasigroup satisfying this law, the pair of equations `x◇y=a` and `x=y◇b` has a unique solution `x=b/a` and `y=(b/a)/b`, which means that the quasigroup is orthogonal to its (23)-parastrophe.  It is part of a collection of [seven laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00796) with similar properties.
