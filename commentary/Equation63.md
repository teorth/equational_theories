## The "Dupont" equation

Closely related to the ["Dupond" equation, 1692](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1692).  In particular, the "Dupont" equation implies the "Dupond" equation for finite magmas, but probably not for infinite ones.  See [this discussion](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Proposed.20new.20target.3A.2063.20and.201692.20.28.22Dupont.20and.20Dupond.22.29).

This pair shares many similarities with the "Asterix" ([equation 65](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?65)) and "Obelix" ([equation 1491](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1491)) pair.
