In finite magmas, or in quasigroups, it is equivalent to its dual, [law 2128](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2128).

If the squaring map `S: x â†¦ x` is surjective then the magma satisfies the [semi-symmetric quasigroup law 14](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?14).  If the squares form a submagma then that submagma is a semi-symmetric quasigroup.
