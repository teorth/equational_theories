The only idempotent magmas satisfying this law are right-projection magmas.

In a quasigroup, this law implies that all squares are equal ([unipotence law 40](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?40)) and is equivalent to [law 1496](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?1496) `x = (y◇x)◇(y◇(z◇z))`, a twist of the semi-symmetric quasigroup law.
