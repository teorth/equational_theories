This law states that products of the form `x◇(y◇(x◇y))`, and in particular fourth powers `x◇(x◇(x◇x))`, are right units.

In a left quasigroup, this law holds if and only if there exists an element `e` such that `x◇e = x` and `y◇(x◇y) = e◇x` (and in particular the [right crossed-inverse property 4273](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?4273)), if and only if the left division operation defined by `x ◇ (x : y) = y` satisfies [law 481](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?481), namely laws 452 and 481 are parastrophically equivalent.
