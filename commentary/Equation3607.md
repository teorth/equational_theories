## A law for pointed set fibrations over affine Gaussian modules

The submagma `P = {x ◇ y | x, y ∈ M}` satisfies the [affine Gaussian module law 546](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?546), namely is (isomorphic to) a ℤ[√-1]-module equipped with the operation `p◇q  = -p + (√-1) q + c` for some constant `c`, for all `p,q∈P`.  The map `φ: x ↦ (x◇y)◇y` (which is actually independent of `y` and is equal to the right cubing map) is a magma morphism from `M` to `P` that leaves `P` invariant.  In particular, `x◇y = φ(x)◇φ(y)` so the magma operation on `M` consists of projecting to `P` followed by the linear operation on `P`.  Thus, magmas satisfying this law are always submagmas of linear magmas satisfying this law.

The set of squares is a submagma of `P` and coincides with it if `p ↦ 2p` is bijective.

For quasigroups, this law is simply equivalent to law 546.
