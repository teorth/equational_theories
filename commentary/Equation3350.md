This law implies the [commutative law 43](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?43).  The left and right cubes define the same map `C: x ↦ x ◇ (x ◇ x) = (x ◇ x) ◇ x`, and multiplication by any square is the same map, namely `x ◇ (y ◇ y) = C(x)`.  In addition, `x ◇ y` only depends on the orbits of `x` and `y` under the map `C`, namely if for any (not necessarily equal) composition `C∘…∘C(x) = C∘…∘C(z)` and `C∘…∘C(y) = C∘…∘C(w)` then `x ◇ y = z ◇ w`.

The set of squares is a submagma and it satisfies the unipotence law, namely `S(S(x))` is independent of `x`.
