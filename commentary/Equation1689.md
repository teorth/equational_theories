## A non-trivially singleton law

This law was [identified by Kisielewicz](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#Kisielewicz2) as a law that collapses to the [singleton law 2](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2), with a surprisingly lengthy computer-assisted proof.  It can be proved [by Vampire](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Ideas.20for.20unknown.20implications/near/474943773), and has a short proof [by egg](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/458659-Equational/topic/Adding.20the.20egg.20repository.20as.20a.20dependency/near/474359913).  We obtained a [human-readable proof](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#1689_equiv_2) in the course of the project.
