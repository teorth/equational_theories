## A non-trivially singleton law

This law was [identified by Kisielewicz](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0001.html#Kisielewicz2) as a law that collapses to the [singleton law 2](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?2), but all known proofs are [surprisingly lengthy](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/implications-chapter.html#1689_equiv_2).
