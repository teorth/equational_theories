This law implies that the squaring map `S: x ↦ x◇x` is injective, that the right cubing map `C: x ↦ (x◇x)◇x` is idempotent (`C(C(x)) = C(x)`), and that both the left cubes `x◇(x◇x)` and the products `(x◇y)◇x` are in the image of `C` (equivalently are invariant under right cubing).

This law cannot hold in a (non-trivial) commutative magma or quasigroup.
