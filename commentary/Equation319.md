This law implies the [right-zero unipotence law 316](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/implications/?316), namely all squares are equal to an element `e` that is a right zero, namely `x◇e=e` and that products of the form `y◇(_◇y)` are equal to that element.

This law cannot hold in any non-trivial quasigroup.
