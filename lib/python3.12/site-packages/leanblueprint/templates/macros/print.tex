%â€¯In this file you should put macros to be used only by
% the printed version. Of course they should have a corresponding
% version in macros/web.tex.
% Typically the printed version could have more fancy decorations.
% This should be a very short file.

% This file starts with dummy macros that ensure the pdf
% compiler will ignore macros provided by plasTeX that make
% sense only for the web version, such as dependency graph
% macros.

% Make sure that arguments of \uses and \proves are real labels, by using invisible refs:
% latex prints a warning if the label is not defined, but nothing is shown in the pdf file.
% It uses LaTeX3 programming, this is why we use the expl3 package.
