\chapter{Equivalence with the constant and singleton laws}\label{constant-chapter}

\href{https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Generated/Constant.lean}{85 laws}
have been shown to be equivalent to the constant law (\Cref{eq46}), and
\href{https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Generated/Singleton.lean}{815 laws}
have been shown to be equivalent to the singleton law (\Cref{eq2}).

These are the laws up to 4 operations that follow from diagonalization of \Cref{eq2} and \Cref{eq46}.

To formalize these in Lean, a search was run on the list of equations to discover
diagonalizations of these two specific laws: equations of the form $x = R$ where $R$ doesn't include
$x$, and equations of the form $x \circ y = R$ where $R$ doesn't include $x$ or $y$.

The proofs themselves all look alike, and correspond exactly to the two steps described in the proof
of \Cref{diag}. The Lean proofs were generated semi-manually, using search-and-replace starting from
the output of \texttt{grep} that found the diagonalized laws.

In the case of the constant law, \Cref{eq41} ($x \circ x = y \circ z$) wasn't detected using
this method. It was added manually to the file with the existing proof from the sub-graph project.
