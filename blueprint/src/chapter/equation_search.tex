\chapter{Equation Search}

\href{https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/tree/main/equational_theories/Generated/EquationSearch}{Approximately ~500k transitive implications were proven by a custom tool leveraging the implication graph}. After previous brute force had derived many implications expressible as a small number of rewrites, this equation search leveraged the implication graph to search further. It began at a hypothesis, and then attempted to perform substitutions by equations it transitively implied. Due to it's naive implementation, it can not perform all forms of substutions, it is limited to substutions that match the exact text of another equation. This search method benefits from being able to start from a hypothesis and can search for any number of goals, rather than having to search the combined space of all possible hypotheses and goals, and can 'reach' farther positions in the search graph than simple rewriting alone.

An example proof illustrates the logic it uses:

\begin{verbatim}
  have eq3315 (x y : G) : x * y = x * (y * (x * x)) := by
    apply Apply.Equation12_implies_Equation11 at h
    apply RewriteHypothesis.Equation11_implies_Equation3323 at h
    apply Apply.Equation3323_implies_Equation3315 at h
    apply h
  have eq52 (x y : G) : x = x * (y * (x * x)) := by
    apply Apply.Equation12_implies_Equation61 at h
    apply Apply.Equation61_implies_Equation54 at h
    apply Apply.Equation54_implies_Equation52 at h
    apply h
  repeat intro
  nth_rewrite 1 [eq3315]
  nth_rewrite 1 [← eq52]
  apply h
  repeat assumption
\end{verbatim}
