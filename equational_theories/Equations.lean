/-! List of equational laws being studied -/

/-
This files contains a small list of selected Equations. This way this file can be conveniently
viewed and edited, without having to open a very large files.

See `AllEquations.lean` for the remaining ones. Feel free to move individual equations here if
you do manual proofs about them and you want to import just this file. But don't forget to comment out the corresponding copy of the equatoins in `AllEquations.lean` if you do so?

The equations are marked as `abbrev` so that tactics like `decide` will look through the definition.
