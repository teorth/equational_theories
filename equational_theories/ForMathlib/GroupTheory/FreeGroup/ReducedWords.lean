This file defines some extra lemmas for free groups, in particular about (cyclically) reduced words.

## Main statements
* `FreeGroup.infinite_order` : nontrivial elements of a free group have infinite order
* corrollary `FreeGroup.ne_inv_of_ne_one` : nontrivial elements of a free group are not self-inverse.
