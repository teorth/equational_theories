I think I have a sketch for an example of a magma satisfying 206 but not 1648. I use the translation
invariant approach, but for a non-commutative group: let $$ G $$ the free product of three cyclic
groups of order 2. If we have the alphabet $$ A = \{a,b,c\} $$ then we can identify $$ G $$ with the
reduced words in $$ A $$ that have no subwords of the form $$ aa, bb, cc $$.

Our magma will be defined on G and will satisfy
```math
x ◇ y = x f(x^{-1}y)
```
where $$ f \colon G \rightarrow \{1, a, b, c\} $$.

Then the RHS of 206 is
```math
(x ◇ (x ◇ y)) ◇ y = (x ◇ (x f(x^{-1}y)) ◇ y = (x f(f(x^{-1} y))) ◇ y = x  f(f(x^{-1} y)) f( (f(f(x^{-1} y))^{-1} x^{-1} y)
```
Setting $$ z = x^{-1} y $$, we get that 206 is equivalent to
$$ f(f(z)) f ( f(f(z))^{-1} z) = 1 $$. Under the assumption that $$f$$ maps to $$\{1, a, b, c\}$$
(so $$ f(z) = f(z)^{-1} $$), this simplifies to
```math
f(f(z)) = f( f(f(z)) z)
```
 I claim the following f satisfies this: we set
```math
f(1) = 1, f(a) = b, f(b) = c, f(c) = a
```
now, if $$w$$ is a nonempty reduced word not starting in $$a$$, we set $$ f(aw) = a $$, cyclically
symmetric for reduced words starting in b and and c. Let us check that this satisfies $$f(f(z)) = f(
f(f(z)) z)$$:

It is clear that $$ f(f(1)) = f( f(f(1)) 1) = 1 $$.

We have $$ f(f(a)) = f(b) = c$$, and $$f(f(f(a))a) = f(ca) = c$$.

For $$w$$ is a nonempty reduced word not starting in $$a$$, we have
$$ f(f(aw)) = f(a) = b, so f( f(f(aw)) aw) = f(baw) = b$$. The rest follows by symmetry.

I think 1648 translates to
$$ f(z)f(f((f(z))^{-1} z)) = 1 $$
this is not satisfied, as $$ f(a) f(f( (f(a))^{-1} a) = b f(f(ba)) = b f(b) = bc \not= 1 $$.

I hope I haven't made any computational mistakes (this is in fact my second try, :sweat_smile: ),
would someone like to check whether this makes sense? I don't think I would be able to formalize
this in Lean myself.

### Implementation notes

This contains a self-contained development of the free product of three copies of the two-element
group, by defining reduced words, a reduction function, and deriving enough API for it. In the
end we define our magma of interest directly, so this free product group is not explicitly defined.

The development can easily be generalized to more than three copies if needed, just swap out `Fin 3`.
