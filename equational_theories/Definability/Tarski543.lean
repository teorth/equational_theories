Tarski proved that if an operation obeys `x = y ◇ (z ◇ (x ◇ (y ◇ z)))`, then there is a natural
abelian group structure given by
```
0 := x ◇ x (for any, or all, x)
-x := 0 ◇ x
x + y := x ◇ (0 ◇ y)
```
so that `◇` is the "minus" operation in the group. In particular, the resulting `+` operation is
cancelative, commutative, and associative. We show this in terms of the `TermDefinable` predicate.

We define the commutative semigroup structure first, instead of the commutative *group* structure,
because the identity is not actually definable (in first-order logic, nor is it computable in Lean).
Also, in general magmas may be Empty, in which case we have a CommSemigroup structure but not an
identity.

We'll prove it is also `IsCancelMul` later, and give the noncomputable CommGroup structure that
extends this when it's nonempty.
