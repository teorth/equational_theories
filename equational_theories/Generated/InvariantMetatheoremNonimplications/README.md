# Non-implications generated from invariant-based metatheorems

The files in this folder contain proofs of non-implications automatically generated following the theory developed in Chapter 8 of the blueprint.

There is one file for each lifting magma family (see `equational_theories/LiftingMagmaFamilies`). Results that have already been established are omitted from the files.

To regenerate this folder, run `lake exe generate_lifting_magma_family_counterexamples`, which calls the script written in `equational_theories/LiftingMagmaFamiliesCounterexamples`.

More counter-examples of this kind can be generated by defining new instances of `LiftingMagmaFamily` in `equational_theories/LiftingMagmaFamilies` and
manually adding them to the `liftingMagmaFamilyInstances` array in `equational_theories/LiftingMagmaFamiliesCounterexamples`.
