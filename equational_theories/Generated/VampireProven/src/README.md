These are implications [proven by Vampire](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/pull/230)
with a proof formalized in Lean.
The proofs in Proofs1-41.lean were made using vampire_proofs.py.

One can generate counterexamples using Vampire by running `vampire_fin_counterexample.py`.
The found counterexamples will appear in `Disproofs*.lean`.
