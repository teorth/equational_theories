In this file we introduce "Sheffer Algebras", which are simply a presentation of Boolean Algebras,
but with a single operation, the Sheffer stroke, or NAND, as the only primitive operation.
This operation satisfies 3 laws, the Sheffer axioms.

The structure of the development roughly follows the original Sheffer paper, "A set of five
independent postulates for Boolean algebras, with application to logical constants".

The main result of this file is that the Sheffer stroke is a complete axiomatization of Boolean
Algebras, and vice versa. The latter is done by showing that the Sheffer stroke
(defined as `a | b = (a ∧ b)ᶜ`) satisfies the three Sheffer axioms.

The other direction is a bit more fiddly, and requires a careful set of lemmas, which give a
structure involving `⊔` and `⊓` which is similar but distinct from the ring structure of a Boolean
Ring. The final tie in with actual Boolean algebras follows the surprisingly detailed Wikipedia
article found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure)#Axiomatics

We also introduce a class for the Sheffer stroke notation, for convenience.
