The purpose of this project, launched on Sep 25, 2024, is to explore the space of equational theories of magmas, ordered by implication. To begin with we shall focus only on theories of a single equation, and specifically on [this list](equational_theories/AllEquations.lean) of 4694 equations (all laws involving at most four magma operations, up to symmetry and relabeling).  This creates 4694*(4694-1) = 22,028,942 implications that need to be proven or disproven.

Some selected equations of interest are listed [here](equational_theories/Equations.lean) (in Lean form) and [here](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/subgraph-eq.html) (in a human readable blueprint).

Some automatically generated progress:
- Sep 28, 2024: [85 laws](equational_theories/Generated/Constant.lean) have been shown to be equivalent to the constant law [`Equation46`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/subgraph-eq.html#eq46), and [815 laws](equational_theories/Generated/Singleton.lean) have been shown to be equivalent to the singleton law [`Equation2`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/subgraph-eq.html#eq2).  Discussed in the blueprint [here](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0005.html).
- Sep 28, 2024: [18972 implications](equational_theories/Generated/SimpleRewrites/theorems) were established by simple rewrite laws.  Discussed in the blueprint [here](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0006.html).
- Sep 28, 2024: [4.2m implications proven by a transitive reduction of 15k theorems](equational_theories/Generated/TrivialBruteforce) were proven using simple rewrite proof scripts.  Discussed in the blueprint [here](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0007.html).
- Sep 29, 2024: [13.7m implications were conjectured to be refused by a collection of 515 magmas](equational_theories/Generated/All4x4Tables), collected by enumerating all 4^(4*4) operators and reducing to a covering set. Discussed in the blueprint [here](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0008.html).
- Oct 1, 2024: Another [~250k transitive implications](equational_theories/Generated/TrivialBruteforce) were proven by simple proof generation. Discussed in the blueprint [here](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0007.html).
- Oct 1, 2024: [~500k transitive implications](equational_theories/Generated/EquationSearch) were proven by a custom tool that chooses hypotheses and leveraged previously found implications to search by using the implied equations as substitutions.  Discussed in the blueprint [here](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/sect0009.html).

Some statistics and data files from a given point in time:
- Sep 28, 2024: [A repository of unknown implications](https://github.com/amirlb/equational_theories/tree/unknown-implications), including all unknown implications, known equivalence classes, unknown implications modulo known equivalence, and only the strongest unknown implications.
- Sep 29, 2024: [Here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/user_uploads/3121/7ImuNeVLCa_gIsS8bHYIsokB/direct.tar.xz) is a text file of the (21K or so) direct implications proven to date, and [here](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/user_uploads/3121/wnbVe2BZ1gamFjlMYFE7sIs9/closure.tar.xz) is the transitive closure of these implications (about 4.5m). More precisely, we have 21791 implications explicitly proven true, 4494090 additional relations implicitly proven true, 739207 explicitly proven false, 12764328 implicitly proven false, one additional relations explicitly conjectured true (and 64 more implicitly conjectured true), and 4014155 remaining implications which remain completely open.  Quotienting out by known equivalences, there are 3182453 open implications remaining.

Some visualizations from a given point in time:
- Sep 28, 2024: A (manually created) [Hasse diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram) of the [dependencies obtained up to this date](equational_theories/Subgraph.lean) for the [selected equations of interest](equational_theories/Equations.lean) can be found [here](images/implications.png).  Note: the orientation in these legacy images is reversed from that in current guidance.
- Sep 28, 2024: A directed acyclic graph of automatically generated implications is [here](images/implications_092824.svg?raw=true): circular vertices are for nodes representing multiple equivalent equations and equations in green are from [`Subgraph.lean`](equational_theories/Subgraph.lean). Note: the orientation in these legacy images is reversed from that in current guidance.
- Oct 1, 2024: An image visualizing the graph of proved results can be found [here](images/outcomes_20241001.png). This was generated by [`outcomes_to_image.py`](scripts/outcomes_to_image.py).
