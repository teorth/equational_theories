The purpose of this project, launched on Sep 25, 2024, is to explore the space of equational theories of magmas, ordered by implication.  To begin with we shall focus only on theories of a single equation, and specifically on [this list](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/AllEquations.lean) of 4694 equations (all laws involving at most four magma operations, up to symmetry and relabeling).  This creates 4694*(4694-1) = 22,028,942 implications that need to be proven or disproven.

Some selected equations are listed [here](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Equations.lean).  A (manually created) [Hasse diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram) of the [dependencies obtained so far](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Subgraph.lean) for these selected equations can be found [here](images/implications.png).

Some automatically generated progress:
- Sep 28, 2024: [85 laws](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Generated/Constant.lean) have been shown to be equivalent to the constant law [`Equation46`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/subgraph-eq.html#eq46), and [815 laws](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/blob/main/equational_theories/Generated/Singleton.lean) have been shown to be equivalent to the singleton law [`Equation2`](https://teorth.github.io/equational_theories/blueprint/subgraph-eq.html#eq2).
- Sep 28, 2024: [53905 implications](https://github.com/teorth/equational_theories/tree/main/equational_theories/SimpleRewrites/theorems) were established by simple rewrite laws.

Coming soon: statistics on how many implications have been established so far, and visualization tools to explore the implication graph.
